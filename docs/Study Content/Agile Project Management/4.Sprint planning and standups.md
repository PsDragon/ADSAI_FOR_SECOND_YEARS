# Sprint planning and standup meetings

Yesterday we've created our roadmap, so now we're ready to plan our first sprint!
Sprint planning is an event in scrum that kicks off the sprint.
The purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be delivered in the
sprint and how that work will be achieved. Sprint planning is done in
collaboration with the whole scrum team.

Scrum takes the Sprint Planning step very seriously.
Each person on the team is asked whether they commit to the stories in the sprint,
and each person is expected to say either yes they do or no they don't and why.
If someone can't commit, the PO and team need to work together to change the
shape of the sprint until everyone can commit.

Sprint planning is a key collaborative effort in scrum.
You'll repeat this meeting at the beginning of each sprint,
and you'll become better at it every time.

## Standup meetings
Said another way, a stand-up is a daily meeting that involves the core team:
product owners, developers, and the scrum master.
This meeting’s flavor is unique to each team, but generally,
use three simple questions to generate structure:

- [ ] What did I work on yesterday?
- [ ] What am I working on today?
- [ ] What issues are blocking me?

These questions highlight progress and help flag team blockers.
Also, it strengthens the team when everyone shares the progress they’re
contributing to the team. The daily reinforcement of sharing individual
successes and plans keeps everyone excited about the team’s overall contribution
to the organization.
