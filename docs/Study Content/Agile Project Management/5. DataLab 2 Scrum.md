# DataLab: Agile Scrum Project Management - Sprint Planning

Now that we have the vision of the project and a roadmap ready, it's time
to get down to work and finalize the first sprint. For the course of this project,
we recommend you to follow a weekly sprint cycle.

## Stand-up meeting
We'll start with a stand-up meeting for the entire class where each team has their own seperate 10 minute stand-up (including the product owner); the other team watches. The points we'll discuss today are:
- [ ] What did I work on yesterday?
- [ ] What am I working on today?
- [ ] What issues are blocking me?


## Team Communication workshop
At 9:30 we're going to have a workshop on team communication! Here we'll learn about the do's and don't for effective team communication!


## Break time!
Go and have a coffee, remember to ask me for my card because I'll forget otherwise!

## Today's Team Objectives
Now that we know where we're at (stand-up) and how to communicate effectively as a team, it's time to transform our knowledge into action! Let's start by working together on the following objectives!
- [ ] Present the first sprint to the product owner.
- [ ] Finalize the first sprint based on the product owner's feedback.
- [ ] Use Jira to allocate tasks to team members and start the first sprint.

When finalizing/creating the sprint planning, we want you to focus on planning the:

- [ ] **The What** <br>
  The product owner describes the objective(or goal) of the sprint and what
  backlog items contribute to that goal. The scrum team decides what can be done
  in the coming sprint and what they will do during the sprint to make that happen.
<br>
- [ ] **The How** <br>
  The development team plans the work necessary to deliver the sprint goal.
  Ultimately, the resulting sprint plan is a negotiation between the
  development team and product owner based on value and effort.
<br>
- [ ] **The Who** <br>
  You cannot do sprint planning without the product owner or the development
  team. The product owner defines the goal based on the value that they seek.
  The development team needs to understand how they can or cannot deliver that
   goal. If either is missing from this event it makes planning the sprint almost
    impossible.
<br>
- [ ] **The Inputs**<br>
  A great starting point for the sprint plan is the product backlog as it
  provides a list of ‘stuff’ that could potentially be part of the current
  sprint. The team should also look at the existing work done in the
  increment and have a view to capacity.
<br>
- [ ] **The Outputs**<br>
  The most important outcome for the sprint planning meeting is
  that the team can describe the goal of the sprint and how it will
  start working toward that goal. This is made visible in the sprint backlog.

That's it, now we just loop every week and follow our scrum methodology!
