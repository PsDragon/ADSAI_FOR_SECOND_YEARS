# Getting Product Owner Approvement

Now that we have the vision of the project and a roadmap ready, it's time
to get down to work and finalize the first sprint. Finalizing the first sprint means
getting the Product Owner (PO) to sign-off on the project vision, roadmap, backlog and first sprint.

## Team Objectives
Now it's time to transform our knowledge into action! Let's start by working together on the following objectives:
- [ ] Prepare present a walkthrough of the first sprint to the product owner before Monday at 15:00. Make sure it is no longer than 30 minutes.
- [ ] Inviting the Product Owner for a Sprint Planning session in Microsoft Teams.
- [ ] Finalize the first sprint based on the product owner's feedback.
- [ ] Use Trello to allocate tasks to team members and start the first sprint.
- [ ] Do a risk assessment using [Trello](https://youtu.be/LnPlT_Qz4Uo).
- [ ] Do our first peer-review.

## Presenting Sprint Planning to the Product owner
Walk the Product Owner (PO) through your:
- Trello project page;
- roadmap;
- sprint planning.

If the product owner is occupied with the other team, continue with the Linkedin Learning course on risk management below!

## Risk Assessment
Risk assessment is a vital part of project management, essentially we manage and plan our projects so we can manage the risk of not succesfully completing our project. That risk can be broken down into all kinds of higher and lower level component and that's where the Linkedin course below is all about!

Did you notice how you can use Trello Board in all kinds of capacities to visually communicate, order and store information? You can use it for all kinds of use-cases but it works especially good in team context.  **Do a risk assessement in [Trello](https://youtu.be/LnPlT_Qz4Uo).**




## Finalizing the sprint planning
When finalizing/creating the sprint planning, we want you to focus on planning the mandatory aspects for each story (or task) when creating a Trello card for them:

- [ ] **The What** <br>
  The product owner describes the objective(or goal) of the sprint and what
  backlog items contribute to that goal. The scrum team decides what can be done
  in the coming sprint and what they will do during the sprint to make that happen.
<br>
- [ ] **The How** <br>
  The development team plans the work necessary to deliver the sprint goal.
  Ultimately, the resulting sprint plan is a negotiation between the
  development team and product owner based on value and effort.
<br>
- [ ] **The Who** <br>
  You cannot do sprint planning without the product owner or the development
  team. The product owner defines the goal based on the value that they seek.
  The development team needs to understand how they can or cannot deliver that
   goal. If either is missing from this event it makes planning the sprint almost
    impossible.
<br>
- [ ] **The Inputs** <br>
  A great starting point for the sprint plan is the product backlog as it
  provides a list of ‘stuff’ that could potentially be part of the current
  sprint. The team should also look at the existing work done in the
  increment and have a view to capacity.
<br>
- [ ] **The Outputs** <br>
  The most important outcome for the sprint planning meeting is
  that the team can describe the goal of the sprint and how it will
  start working toward that goal. This is made visible in the sprint backlog.
<br>
- [ ] **The Assessment** <br>
  For your learning experience it's important to work on one or more tasks
  related to each Intended Learning Outcome S(ILO). This does not entale you doing every part yourself, contributing to a task by review somebody's work or doing part of the work already counts: you can't all tune the same ML model for example. Therefore it's important to attach ILO labels to each issue (each task, user story or bug), like the image below! **Please note that this step is vital for evidencing your work and link the tasks in your worklog and learning log!!!**.

Create a new board in trello and create headers for all the main categories of planning components above (what, how, who, inputs, outpust, asessment) and create Trello cards under those respective headers to adequate overview of all planning components (at least one per category). 


## Peer-review
Open the peer-review Excel file and inspect it. **Don't fill it in untill the end of the sprint** and follow the instructions in the document! You can find it in this block's assignment on Microsoft Teams. Only you can see it and it only counts for your personal grade! However, you are expected to bring the action points you generate for your teammembers to the table during the retrospective each week! Therefore, you should complete your peer-review Friday morning; first thing you do, before starting the retrospective!

# FIN
That's it, now we just loop every week and follow our scrum methodology!
