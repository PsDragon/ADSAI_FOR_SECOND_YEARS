### 2. Minority Report & Outline

After you have watched Minority Report, ask yourself 'What AI technologies, methods, and/or practices etc. were depicted in the movie?'. When you have successfully identified an AI topic, search the internet for information that can be used as evidence to support your argument. [Google](https://www.google.com/) is often a good starting point. Other useful sources: [Papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/), and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/international). Do not restrict yourself to one single source, try to look for multiple sources to back your arguments with.

Furthermore, try to evaluate the feasibility of the AI topic by critically assessing its possible application(s) within a business setting. As with the AI topic, support your arguments with information found in credible sources.
