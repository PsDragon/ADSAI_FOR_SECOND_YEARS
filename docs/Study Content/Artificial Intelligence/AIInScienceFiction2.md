### 1. Introduction

During the day, you will be given the opportunity to work on your report. Additionally, there will be a formative feedback session where you, and one of the lecturers will discuss your outline for the final assignment.

So what are you waiting for? Open that laptop, and start now :sunglasses:!

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask them. The teaching staff will be available throughout the Datalab session.

#### 2. Reflection (16:00-17:00)

__2a__ Choose, and provide an answer to at least of the following questions:

1. What surprised you today, and why?
2. What’s the most important thing you learned today? Why do you think so?
3. What do you want to learn more about, and why?
4. When were you the most creative, and why do you think that is?
5. What made you curious today? How does learning feel different when you’re curious?
6. When were you at your best today, and why?
7. (Assuming we were studying the same thing and you could decide and have access to anything), where would you start tomorrow? Why?
8. What can/should you do with what you know?
