### 2. Minority Report & Outline

After you have watched Minority Report, ask yourself 'What AI technologies, methods, and/or practices etc. were depicted in the movie?'. When you have successfully identified an AI topic, search the internet for information that can be used as evidence to support your argument. [Google](https://www.google.com/) is often a good starting point. Other useful sources: [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/), [Nature](https://www.nature.com/), [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/), and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/international). Do not restrict yourself to one single source, try to look for multiple sources to back your arguments with.

Furthermore, try to evaluate the feasibility of the AI topic by critically assessing its possible application(s) within a business setting. As with the AI topic, support your arguments with information found in credible sources.

Tip: For more information on the credibility of sources, see <a href="./documents/source_credibility.pdf">How To Select The Best Sources</a> by Buttram et al. (November 2012).

As part of the creative brief you are required to present a first draft, in the form of an outline, where you touch upon the following topics:

1. Analysis of an AI topic within the movie Minority Report;
2. The feasibility of the AI topic and the explanation of how this AI topic or a similar AI topic is being implemented within a specific business setting.
