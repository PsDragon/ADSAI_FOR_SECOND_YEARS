## 2) DataLab preparation (Week 1, DataLab 2):

The next DataLab session, we will focus on strengthening our presentation skills. As part of the learning process, you will be asked to participate in a in-class workshop. In order to participate in this workshop, you will need to have a topic for your presentation:  

- [ ] If you have not found, and described a 'milestone' in the history of AI yet, please do so by the end of the day (Exercise 1.1c, Wednesday, Week 1).
- [ ] Open your [**YourName_BlockA_DataLabPreparation**] markdown file, and add a description of your chosen history of AI 'milestone'. Commit the changes, and push the markdown file to your personal BUas repository.

Note: When you are finished with the independent study material, and still have some time left, try to apply your newly gained knowledge to the Creative Brief.
