### 3. Foundations of AI

#### 3.1 What is artificial intelligence?

Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a rapid rise in popularity. Research into the field of AI is rocketing, and an increasing number of companies are incorporating AI technologies into their daily business operations. But, what does AI constitute?

:pencil: __3.1a__ Watch the TEDx talk 'Understanding Artificial Intelligence and Its Future' by Neil Nie.

*Video 1. TEDx talk 'Understanding Artificial Intelligence and Its Future' by Neil Nie.*

:pencil: __3.1b__ How would you define 'artificial intelligence'?

:pencil: __3.1c__ Give three examples of AI applications. You can choose real-life examples, but also examples from popular culture (e.g., movies, books, video games etc.).

### 3.2 Philosophy of artificial intelligence

In this section, you will be made familiar with the various definitions of AI, and its related fields (e.g., cognitive science). The information required to complete this section successfully, can (to a greater extent) be found in the book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Russell and Norvig (2021)<sup>[1](#footnote_1)</sup>. You will be using this specific book throughout the program.

<img src="./images/ai_russell_norvig.jpg" alt="Book Russell and Norvig" width="300"/>

*Figure 1. Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Russell and Norvig, 2021).*

You can purchase the book or borrow it from BUas' library. The library currently has three copies available.

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #8a6d3b;; background-color: #fcf8e3; border-color: #faebcc;">
Tip: Incorporate some screen-free time in your schedule by reading a paper copy of a book/article etc. instead of a digital one. Your eyes will thank me later.
</div>

:pencil: __3.2a__ Read the first two sub-chapters of the book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Russell and Norvig (2021) (p.19-35).

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #8a6d3b;; background-color: #fcf8e3; border-color: #faebcc;">
Tip: If you cannot find the answer to a question in the provided literature, try to look for an answer online.
</div>

:pencil: __3.2b__ Define the following terms: 'weak AI', and 'strong AI'.

:pencil: __3.2c__ If you have not taken a coffee break yet, take one right now (with your fellow students via Microsoft Teams)! Unlike computers, humans are only able to maintain true focus for around 45 minutes. If you are experiencing some difficulties concentrating, check out the [Pomodoro technique](https://pomofocus.io/).

:pencil: __3.2d__ What is the 'Chinese room experiment'? Describe its procedure.

:pencil: __3.2e__ What is the 'Chinese room experiment' supposed to show? Select the correct statement, and elaborate on your choice:

a) Computers are not yet able to simulate the human ability to understand
\
b) Understanding involves more than the ability to formally reproduce appropriate outputs
\
c) It is only possible for systems to demonstrate understanding
\
d) No machine can demonstrate genuine understanding

:pencil:__3.2f__ Connect the Post It notes (Fig 2.) to the relevant quadrant in the philosophy matrix (Fig 3.). For example, A = 1, 2, and  B = 3, 4, 5 etc. Elaborate on your choices.

:pencil: __3.2g__ After completing the readings and exercises of this section, would you provide the same answer to exercise 2.1b? Explain your answer.

### 4. Information literacy

As a data professional is is important to be able to find, evaluate, and use information effectively. In this section, you will be introduced to the concept of information literacy:

> Information literacy is the ability to discover and use various types of information. It's an essential skill for navigating the information age. Watch this course to learn about strategies for finding information—from a library, archive, database, or the Internet—and the ethics of using it. Librarian Elsa Loftis discusses different types of resources and explains how to evaluate their usefulness and trustworthiness. She also shows how to avoid plagiarism and copyright infringement, and accurately cite sources ([Source](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/information-literacy/welcome?autoplay=true&resume=false&u=36359204)).

:pencil: __4a__ Complete the LinkedIn course [Information Literacy](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/information-literacy/welcome?autoplay=true&resume=false&u=36359204) (Optional). Unless you are a trained librarian or data professional, we highly recommend you to take the course. Rather read a book? Then, visit LibreTexts and use one of the books listed on the webpage [Research and Information Literacy](https://human.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Research_and_Information_Literacy).

:pencil: __4b__ Identify, and select an AI related topic within one of the following BUAS domains:

- Tourism
- Logistics
- Games

Write your answer down.

__Example:__ Autonomous shipping (BUAS domain: Logistics)

:pencil: __4c__ Find one scholarly source, and one popular source of information on your chosen AI topic. Tip: Use one of the search strategies presented in the Information Literacy course (e.g., Boolean searching).

:pencil: __4d__ Create an in-text, and bibliography citation for your popular, and scholarly source.

__Example:__

Scholarly source: [Towards Autonomous Shipping: Benefits and
Challenges in the Field of Information Technology and
Telecommunication](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/99a5/a8d00775e1adf5cac5c1d1c2b0a4b93d98e7.pdf?_ga=2.195360111.2114873160.1652959853-510087269.1652278776)

Bibliography: Yanchin, I., & Petrov, O. (2020). Towards autonomous shipping: Benefits and challenges in the field of information technology and telecommunication. TransNav: International Journal on Marine Navigation and Safety of Sea Transportation, 14.

In-text: (Yanchin and Petrov, 2020)

Popular source: [Automated Marine Highways Are Key to a Nation’s Growth & Security](https://sea-machines.com/automated-marine-highways-are-key-to-a-nations-growth-security/)

Bibliography: Automated Marine Highways Are Key to a Nation's Growth & Security. (2022, February 11). Automated Marine Highways Are Key to a Nation’s Growth & Security https://sea-machines.com/automated-marine-highways-are-key-to-a-nations-growth-security/

In-text: ("Automated Marine Highways Are Key to a Nation's Growth & Security," 2022)

:pencil: __4e__ Imagine writing a research report, and finding a quote similar to one below.

> Much has been written about AI's potential to reflect both the best and the worst of humanity. For example, we have seen AI providing conversation and comfort to the lonely; we have also seen AI engaging in racial discrimination. Yet the biggest harm that AI is likely to do to individuals in the short term is job displacement, as the amount of work we can automate with AI is vastly bigger than before. As leaders, it is incumbent on all of us to make sure we are building a world in which every individual has an opportunity to thrive (Andrew Ng, Co-founder and led of Google Brain).

After a thorough evaluation, you decide to include the quote in your report. List, and describe three approaches that help you incorporate the information correctly, thereby avoiding plagiarism. Write your answer down.

:pencil: __4f__ Reading scholarly text can be complex at first, but when you get the hang of it, you will most likely enjoy reading them because they often provide valuable new insights that you can use for your projects. The following guide shows you how to effectively read a research article by applying a practical and efficient three-pass method. Please, describe the three-pass procedure. Write your answer down.

- [How to read a paper](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf)

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #8a6d3b;; background-color: #fcf8e3; border-color: #faebcc;">
Note: As you might have noticed, Computing Machinery and Intelligence (Turing, 1950) does not look like your typical data science or artificial intelligence research article. It is missing headings such as 'Introduction', 'Experiments', and/or 'Conclusion'. A good example of a traditional artificial intelligence (i.e., computer vision) article can be found, <a href="./documents/YOLO_paper.pdf">here</a>.
