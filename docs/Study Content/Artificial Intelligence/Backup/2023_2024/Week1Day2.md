## __DataLab I: Creative Brief__

### Week 1: Chapter overview

I. Philosophy of AI & Information literacy <br>
II. __DataLab I: Creative Brief__ <br>
III. History of AI & GitHub <br>
IV. Python programming <br>
V. DataLab II: Creative Brief & Presenting <br>

### 1. Introduction 

In today's DataLab session, we will watch the movie Minority Report and subsequently start analyzing it for the assignment 'AI in Science Fiction' (i.e., presentation). Additionally, you will gain insights into the various roles within a professional data team, understand the responsibilities of a data scientist, and explore the essential skills related to this role. 

__After this chapter, you will be able to:__

- [ ] Describe the main tasks, skills, and responsibilities of a data scientist

__DataLab in-class exercises__ 

For the DataLab in-class exercises (Week 1, Wednesday), you are expected fill in a Microsoft Teams Form called ```DataLab in-class exercises (Week 1, DataLab I)```:

#### 5.1 Roles in Data Science/AI teams

> Data-driven organization. Youâ€™ve likely heard this buzz phrase hundreds of times. But what does it really mean? And who are people who make data useful? ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5hLUknIi5c)).

:pencil: __5.1a__ Watch the video below and find out what roles constitute a professional data team:

*Video 1. Roles in Data Science Teams by AltexSoft.*

Each Tuesday, you will have the chance to familiarize yourself with the different roles that constitute a professional data team. This week focuses on the __data scientist__.

#### 5.2 Data scientist

:pencil: __5.2a__ Search for a data scientist job description and identify the required skills and responsibilities. Write them down. 

:pencil: __5.2b__ Find out what a typical work day looks like for a data scientist (e.g., daily tasks, and related skills, etc.), and create a timeline that visualizes the data scientist's work day. A timeline of a university lecturer is provided below as an example:

- 8:00 AM - 9:00: Prepare for the day (e.g., check emails, prepare lectures, etc.)
- 9:00 AM - 11:00: Morning Lectures (e.g., decision trees, confusion matrix notation, etc.)
- 11:00 AM - 11:30: Break and Office Hours
- 11:30 AM - 13:00: Afternoon Lectures (e.g., clustering)
- 13:00 PM - 14:00: Lunch Break
- 14:00 PM - 15:30: Student Meetings and Course Preparation (e.g., formative feedback, preparing assignments, etc.)
- 15:30 PM - 17:00: Grading and Administrative Tasks (e.g., grading assignments, answering emails, etc.)
- 17:00 PM - 18:00: Professional Development and Research (e.g., reading scientific articles, writing scientific articles, etc.)

### 6. DataLab tasks 

As part of the Creative Brief you are required to give a 7-minute presentation, where you identify, and describe an AI topic in the movie Minority Report, and place it within the Taxonomy of AI (i.e. domains, and subdomains). In addition, you will need to evaluate the technical feasibility of the AI topic by critically assessing its possible application(s) within a real-life (business) setting. Furthermore, you will need to articulate potential ethical and/or legal implications of the AI application. Lastly, in order to meet the information needs for the Minority Report presentation, you will need to acquire, evaluate, and use information from various popular and/or scholarly sources, such as blogs and scientific journal articles.

*__But, where do I start...__*

We created so called DataLab tasks, which are exercises that are linked to the criteria of the ILOs, listed in the assessment rubric. Please, take a look at this page: __[DataLab Tasks](ADD URL)__, to see what you need to do to successfully complete the Creative Brief, and get a good final grade :clap: :sparkles:.

Note: In DataLab, we will dedicate most of our time to the DataLab tasks. These tasks have been specifically designed to foster exploration and provide you with the flexibility to work at your preferred pace.
