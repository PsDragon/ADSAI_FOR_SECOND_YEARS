### Week 1: Chapter overview

I. Philosophy of AI & Information literacy <br>
II. DataLab I: Creative Brief <br>
III. History of AI & GitHub <br>
IV. Python programming <br>
V. __DataLab II: Creative Brief & Presenting__ <br>

### 1. Introduction

In today's DataLab session, we will focus on strengthening our presentation skills. As a data professional, it is paramount that you can communicate your findings effectively:

> You can be the best data scientist — if you can't present your findings in a meaningful, engaging and memorable way — you won't make any impact. Simple as that. I mean, you don't have to be the next Steve Jobs… but you have to be a good enough presenter to let everyone in management understand the key takeaways of your data projects ([Source](https://data36.com/soft-skills-data-scientist/)).

To prepare you for the informative speech, i.e., the presentation 'AI in Science Fiction', we created a couple of exercises. Because, we all know:

*Figure 1. Sad, but true...*

These exercises will, among others, help you structure your speech and reduce some of the stage fright you might have. 

__After this chapter, you will be able to:__

1. Define the term 'informative speech'
2. List and describe the four types of informative speeches
3. List, and describe techniques to make informative speeches interesting, coherent, and memorable
4. Write an outline for an informative speech
5. Confidently deliver a informative speech to peers, and teaching staff members

### 4. Presenting 

In this section, we will focus on the art of presenting, an essential skill for any professional. The ability to deliver a well-structured and engaging presentation is highly valuable, especially when sharing knowledge about a complex topic like AI. Throughout this section, you will learn how to prepare and deliver an informative speech effectively.

#### 4.1 Preparing a presentation 

:pencil: __4.1a__ Read [Chapter 15](https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Communication/Public_Speaking/Public_Speaking_(The_Public_Speaking_Project)/15%3A_Informative_Speaking) of the book Public Speaking by The Public Speaking Project. This particular chapter will teach you how to create and deliver an informative speech.

:pencil:  __4.1b__ What is an informative speech? And what are the four types described in the book Public Speaking? Write your answer down.

:pencil:  __4.1c__ What makes an informative speech interesting, coherent, and memorable? List, and describe at least one technique.

:pencil:  __4.1d__ Prepare a 3-minute informative speech where you present your history of AI 'milestone':
  - Create an outline for your presentation
  - Think about the tool(s) that you would like to use for your presentation (e.g. PowerPoint, whiteboard etc.)
  - Practice your presentation (this includes timing it!)

### 5. DataLab tasks 

After finishing the in-class exercises, try to apply your newly gained knowledge to the Creative Brief. For example, you could create an outline for your 'AI in Science Fiction' presentation, and discuss its content with your peers and/or mentor. For the DataLab tasks page, click [here](ADD URL).
