### 2. What is data, information and knowledge?

>An ounce of information is worth a pound of data.
<br>An ounce of knowledge is worth a pound of information.
<br>An ounce of understanding is worth a pound of knowledge ([Source](http://faculty.ung.edu/kmelton/documents/datawisdom.pdf)). 

:pencil: __2a__ Although the terms 'data', 'information', and 'knowledge' are often used interchangeably, they are not the same. Read [From Data to Wisdom](http://faculty.ung.edu/kmelton/documents/datawisdom.pdf) by Ackoff, and [Data Demystified â€” DIKW model](https://towardsdatascience.com/rootstrap-dikw-model-32cef9ae6dfb
) by Figueroa to see how these terms represent different stages of value creation from data.

More and more particles gathered together which renders the atmosphere unable to hold them anymore. On their way down to earth, the remaining water vapor freezes and crystals form which connect and hook together thereby creating a snowflake.      | Based on previous observations and statistical models, we are able to predict the weather in the future. We developed an understanding of the different interactions between temperature changes, evaporation and snow.|

### 3. Data analysis 

#### 3.1 Methods

Data analysis is the process of transforming raw data, such as texts, images, audio, numbers, and videos, into usable information. There are many different data analysis methods, depending on the type of research. The four most commonly used methods are listed below:

- Descriptive Analytics: tells you what happened in the past
- Diagnostic Analytics: helps you understand why something happened in the past
- Predictive Analytics: predicts what is most likely to happen in the future
- Prescriptive Analytics: recommends actions you can take to affect those outcomes ([Source](https://insightsoftware.com/blog/comparing-descriptive-predictive-prescriptive-and-diagnostic-analytics/))

In the field of AI, we mainly perform predictive analytics:

> Predictive analytics is the use of data, statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data. The goal is to go beyond knowing what has happened to providing a best assessment of what will happen in the future ([Source](https://www.sas.com/nl_nl/insights/analytics/predictive-analytics.html)).

However, you cannot successfully perform a predictive analysis before you have completed a descriptive and diagnostic analysis.  

__Example: COVID-19__

<img src="./images/hospital.jpg" alt="Doctors emergency room" width="400"/>

*Figure 2. Emergency room.*

Let us say you work as an emergency room doctor in a hospital, and you, on average, treat ten patients daily. Suddenly, the number of patients admitted to the emergency room rises starkly.

*__Descriptive analytics__* would help you explain what happened by effectively visualizing comprehensive, accurate, and real-time data. 

__Tools:__ Power BI, Tableau, Excel, SQL, etc.

:pencil: __3.1a__ Watch the video What is Descriptive Analytics? - Data Science Wednesday by Decisive Data.

*Video 2. What is Descriptive Analytics? - Data Science Wednesday.*

*__Diagnostic analytics__*, in turn, explores the data further, looking to separate patterns (e.g., correlation) and find the causes of the issue at hand. In other words, it helps you answer the 'Why' question, - i.e., 'Why is there a sharp increase in the number of patients admitted to the emergency room?'. The patient's symptoms, such as couching, and muscle ache, might, for example, point toward one specific viral infection, such as COVID-19.

__Tools:__ Power BI, Excel, R, Python, etc.

:pencil: __3.1b__ Watch the video What is Diagnostic Analytics? - Data Science Wednesday by Decisive Data.

*Video 3. What is Diagnostic Analytics? - Data Science Wednesday.*

Then, *__predictive analytics__* would answer the question 'What will happen in the future?' by providing a forecast of the number of patients with COVID-19-related symptoms that need to be admitted to the emergency room in the next couple of weeks.

__Tools:__ R, Python, Weights & Biases, AWS SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning etc.

__Technique:__ Machine learning

*Video 4. The Fundamentals of Predictive Analytics - Data Science Wednesday.*

Finally, *__prescriptive analytics__* would help you decide what to do next, - e.g., to account for the increase in patients with COVID-19-related symptoms admitted to the emergency room, it is suggested to increase the number of staff accordingly.

__Tools:__ R, Python, SPSS, SAS, etc.

__Technique:__ Statistical modelling

*Video 5. What is Prescriptive Analytics? - Data Science Wednesday.*

:pencil: __3.1e__ Come up with at least one situation, where you could deploy a descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analysis. Elaborate on your answer.

:pencil: __3.1f__ [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) is one of the most popular dashboarding tools. List another dashboarding tool, and provide at least one 'strength' and 'weakness'. Write your answer down.  

:pencil: __3.1g__ In Week 4, you will start to develop your own dashboard with Power BI. In our program, we stimulate self-directed learning, which includes setting your own goals, and identifying relevant sources of information (in the first two years under supervision of a teaching staff member). Let start with the latter; find at least three useful Power BI resources for your Block A project (e.g., books, online tutorials, etc.). List the resources (, and share them with your peers via a post in Microsoft Teams' 'Coffee Corner').  

#### 3.2 Predictive analytics: To learn or not to learn...

Let us take a closer look at the three main approaches to predictive modelling in the field of AI:

<img src="./images/ParadigmsAI.png" alt="The field of AI" width="700"/> 

*Figure 1. The field of AI.*

Rule-based systems/Symbolic AI also referred to as 'Good Old Fashioned AI,' states that '... all intelligent behavior can be captured by a system that reasons logically from a set of facts and rules describing the domain' (Russel and Norvig, 2020). In contrast, (Classic) Machine learning and Deep learning/Connectionist AI do not require a symbolic representation. By feeding the systems with raw information, it can analyze and construct its own implicit knowledge, which in turn can be used to solve a data task, such as the one below.

__Example: GP health check__

Imagine being a data scientist whose task is to develop an analytical model to assist GPs in assessing patients' overall health by predicting if they are 'fit' or 'unfit' based on a few health-related characteristics.

Before you can start to build your model, i.e., apply an algorithm to your dataset, you must select one of the three approaches:

<img src="./images/ParadigmsAILearning.jpg" alt="Types of predictive analytics (learning)" width="700"/> 

*Figure 2. Types of predictive analytics (learning).*

Let us use the following patient record as input for our analytical model:

<img align="left" src="./images/UnhealthyPerson.jpg" alt="Patient record" width="400"/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name: Hans Janssen <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age: 29 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exercise: 0 hours per week <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food: every day a bowl of [Brinta](https://ifunny.co/picture/breakfast-in-the-netherlands-starterpack-peanut-cheese-not-just-for-b46QlAY89?s=cl), and at least five times per week junk food <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work: at last 60 hours per week

<br clear="left"/>

*Figure 3. GP health check: 'Is a patient fit?'.*

To determine if a patient is 'fit' or 'unfit,' you could create the following flowchart that shows the various outcomes from a series of decisions:

<img src="./images/DecisionTreeV2.jpg" alt="Decision Tree" width="600"/>

*Figure 4. Patient: Hans Janssen.*

A flowchart or decision tree, such as the one depicted above, is a typical example of a rule-based system/Symbolic AI model; it requires handcrafted rules created by a (domain) professional. A rule could be, for instance, if a patient is below 30, and eats lots of junk food, the model should classify this patient as 'unfit':

<img src="./images/UnhealthyPersonOutput.png" alt="Patient model output" width="400"/>

*Figure 5. Hans Janssen classified as 'Unfit' by the predictive model.*

In a complex environment, such as our GP health check use case, you can identify numerous factors that might influence the outcome of our decision-making process â€” for example, suffering from a chronic disease or having a vegetarian lifestyle. It is extremely difficult or impossible to account for all these factors in our model. To do so, the (domain) professional would have to create a rule for each possible determinant, significantly increasing our decision tree's depth and/or width. 

Additionally, complex environments are often dynamic, meaning the terms and conditions of being considered 'fit' or 'unfit' change over time. For instance, say all the major fast-food vendors have improved their menus in terms of health; on average, their food contains significantly more nutrients and less harmful fats than before. As a result, regularly eating fast food is not considered unhealthy anymore. However, your rule-based system/Symbolic AI model still thinks it is one of the decisive factors of an unhealthy lifestyle. Therefore, a patient who should be classified as 'fit' based on their junk food eating habits will be classified as 'unfit'.      

It is here where the other approaches, (classic) machine learning, and deep learning/Connectionist AI, come to the rescue. Although using different styles of learning, both 'learn' from the data that is fed to them.

If we look at (classic) machine learning, we see it has a separate feature extraction and model building phase. Features are distinctive characteristics of input patterns that help in differentiating between the various output categories (i.e., 'fit' and 'unfit'). For example, feature extraction, executed by the data scientist, helps the machine learning model identify essential properties of input patterns such as regular exercise and eating junk food. Concerning model building, a machine learning model 'learns' from past data and adjusts its responses accordingly. Initially, the model will misclassify patients such as Hans Janssen, but eventually, it will adjust its rules to account for the changed situation:

<img src="./images/UnhealthyPersonOutputV2.png" alt="Patient model output" width="400"/>

*Figure 5. Hans Janssen classified as 'Fit' by the predictive model.*

Deep learning/Connectionist AI, completely automates the feature extraction and model building phase. The model, not the data scientist, engineers the features; they are 'learned' through evaluating past data, and are often perceived as uninformative from the human perspective due to their numerical and distributed nature. Remember, computers think in ones and zeros, while we humans tend to think in high-level concepts such as exercise and eating lots of fast food. Concerning model building, deep learning/Connectionist AI models work similarly to (classic) machine learning models. They both learn from past experiences.

To deepen our understanding, let us watch a couple of videos, and complete some exercises:

:pencil: __3.2a__ Watch the video 'What is Machine Learning?' by IBM.

*Video 1. 'What is Machine Learning?' by IBM.*

:pencil: __3.2b__ Define the terms 'supervised' and 'unsupervised' learning. How do these types of machine learning differ from each other? Write your answer down.

:pencil: __3.2c__ Watch the video on symbolic AI by the YouTube channel CrashCourse.

:pencil: __3.2e__ Are artificial neural networks (ANNs) similar to the human brain? Support your answer with arguments.

:pencil: __3.2f__ An ANN uses a a) symbolic or b) connectionist approach to AI? Select one of the options, and explain your choice.

</div>

In the last couple of years, there has been a reappraisal of symbolic AI because, among others, it is less susceptible to the so called 'Problem of opacity'. Minsky defines the problem as follows: '... the knowledge embodied inside a network's numerical coefficients is not accessible outside that net.' (1991). In other words, it is difficult to know why these connectionist models do what they do or how they work.

:pencil: __3.2g__ Can you think of a real-life scenario where an AI method that uses a symbolic approach would be more suited than a method that uses a connectionist approach? Explain your answer.
