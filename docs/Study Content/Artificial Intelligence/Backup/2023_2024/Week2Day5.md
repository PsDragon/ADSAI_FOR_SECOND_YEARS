## __DataLab II: Creative Brief & Feedback__

### Week 2: Chapter overview

I. Intelligent Agents & Conversational AI <br>
II. DataLab I: Creative Brief & Turing Test <br>
III. Taxonomy of AI I <br>
IV. Python programming <br>
V. __DataLab II: Creative Brief & Feedback__ <br>

### 1. Introduction 

In today's DataLab session, we will focus on strengthening our feedback skills, which will help us identify and develop each other's strengths and weaknesses. To prepare you for the informative speech, i.e., the presentation 'AI in Science Fiction', we created a couple of in-class exercises. These will, among others, help you to provide constructive feedback to your peers during the presentation. Furthermore, today you will have your bi-weekly formative feedback session with your mentor (Further details to follow, see Microsoft Teams).

__After this chapter, you will be able to:__

- [ ] List, and describe the feedback types, and models presented in the article How to give and receive feedback effectively by Hardavell et al., (2017)
- [ ] Provide constructive feedback (to a peer) by deploying the hamburger/sandwich, and Pendleton feedback model 

__DataLab in-class exercises__ 

For the DataLab in-class exercises (Week 2, Friday), you are expected fill in a Microsoft Teams Form called ```DataLab in-class exercises (Week 2, DataLab II)```:

### 4. Feedback 

#### 4.1 Theory: How to give, and receive feedback?

:pencil: __4.1a__ Read the article [How to give and receive feedback effectively](https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/breathe/13/4/327.full.pdf) by Hardavell et al., (2017). Although originally written for healthcare professionals, it is still relevant for us, ADS&AI students,  because it provides general guidelines on how to effectively provide, and receive feedback.   

:pencil: __4.1b__ List, and describe the types of feedback, and models presented in the article How to give and receive feedback effectively by Hardavell et al., (2017). Write your answer down. 

:pencil: __4.1c__ Complete one of the following courses on the topic of feedback: 

- [Using Feedback to Drive Performance: Everything is feedback](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/using-feedback-to-drive-performance/everything-is-feedback?autoplay=true&u=36359204) (LinkedIn Learning course, Amber Vanderburg and Madecraft)

- [Giving and Receiving Feedback: The art and science of feedback](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/giving-and-receiving-feedback/the-art-and-science-of-feedback-2?autoplay=true&u=36359204) (LinkedIn Course, Gemma Leigh Roberts)

- [Giving Helpful Feedback, Week 1:Introduction to Giving Helpful Feedback and Positive Feedback](https://www.coursera.org/learn/feedback#syllabus) (Coursera course, Tracy Jennings)

:pencil: __4.1d__ Watch the video below, and provide feedback to the presenter according to the sandwich/hamburger model. List the feedback, and explain your approach.

*Video 1. Undergraduate Students Unwittingly Subjected to World's Worst Research Presentation.*

:pencil: __4.1e__ Compare your answer to exercise 2d with the feedback given by two of your peers. Is the feedback similar, or does it differ across peers? Elaborate on your findings. 

:pencil: __4.1f__ Watch the video 'Run, hide, or say thank you: when faced with feedback, what do you do?' by Joy Mayer. Summarize the main points presented in the video (maximum of 150 words). 

<iframe width="896" height="504" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b0bS4xJiEU8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*Video 2. 'Run, hide, or say thank you: when faced with feedback, what do you do?'*

:pencil: __4.1g__ Team up with a peer, and provide feedback on each others work (Yesterday's DataLab preparation exercise) using the Pendleton model: 

__1. What did you do well?__

*Peer 1 (mentee) comments on what they did well - get them to describe these actions.*

__2. What I thought you did well?__

*Peer 2 (mentor) may concur with peer 1, and add additional comments on what peer 1 (mentee) did well.*

__3. What could you have done better?__

*Peer 1 (mentee) comments on how they could improve.*

__4. What I think you could have done better?__

*Peer 2 (mentor) may concur with peer 1, and adds additional comments on how they can improve.*  

:pencil: __4.1h__ In the bi-weekly formative feedback sessions between student and mentor, the teaching staff members deploy various feedback methods (e.g., the Pendleton model). Think about how you, as a student, can prepare for such as session. Write your findings down. 

During the 'AI in Science Fiction' presentation you will be asked to provide constructive feedback to your peers.

:pencil: __4.1i__ Open your [__YourName_GitHubExercise__] markdown file, and list at least one element, related to the 'AI in Science Fiction' presentation, you want to receive feedback on.  Commit the changes, and push the markdown file to your personal BUas Block A repository.

#### 3.2 Practice time!

After the lunch break, you will participate in a workshop by Bert Heesakkers ADD LOCATION, where you have the chance put your newly gained knowledge on giving, and receiving feedback into practice.
