IV. Python programming <br>
V. DataLab II: 'AI in Science Fiction' presentations <br>

### 1. Introduction 

In today's independent study material, you will learn to apply the practice of ethical reflecting, questioning, and decision-making within the field of AI. Furthermore, by the end of the day, you will be familiar with some of the risks and benefits associated with implementing AI technology in society.

### 2. Introduction to data ethics

:pencil: __2a__ Read sub-chapters 1.4 and 1.5 of AIMA (p.45-52).

:pencil: __2b__ Watch the TEDx talk 'The era of blind faith in big data must end' by Cathy O'Neill.

*Video 1. TEDx talk 'The era of blind faith in big data must end' by Cathy O'Neill*

:pencil: __2c__ In the video, she makes the following statement: 'Algorithms are opinions embedded in code'. What do you think she means with this statement, and what are the possible implications that could arise from it? Explain your answer.

:pencil: __2d__ Read the module <a href="./documents/IntroToDataEthicsModule1.pdf">Introduction to Data Ethics</a>, and subsequently complete the exercises. Discuss your findings with a peer. Remember: There are no right or wrong answers here because many of the questions are open-ended, asking for personal reflection on values and professional goals, not factual assertions. 

:pencil: __2e__ In the article [How to make a chatbot that isn't racist or sexist](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/23/1011116/chatbot-gpt3-openai-facebook-google-safety-fix-racist-sexist-language-ai/) Will Douglas Heaven presents three approaches to making chatbots safe for public use. List, and briefly describe these approaches, and explain why it is so difficult to stop a language model from generating offensive texts. Write your answer down.

For details on GPT-3, see the video and article:

- [Language Models are Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf) (Optional, we will not ask you to read the 70+ pages...)

:pencil: __2f__ Find three newspaper articles on a risk and/or benefit associated with a domain and subdomain of AI (e.g., perception, computer vision, planning, natural language processing, searching, etc.), and fill in the table below:

__Example:__ [China's hi-tech war on its Muslim minority](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/apr/11/china-hi-tech-war-on-muslim-minority-xinjiang-uighurs-surveillance-face-recognition) 

| A. Organization/state/actor, etc.   |  B. AI topic |  C. AI domain & subdomain | D. Benefit/Risk  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Chinese government  | Surveillance cameras equipped with facial recognition software  | Perception, computer vision, learning, and machine learning  | These AI technologies facilitate the prosecution of Uighurs by the Chinese government      |
| 2.    |   |   |   |   |
| 3.   |   |   |   |   |
| 4.  |   |   |   |   |

To prepare for your 'AI in Science Fiction' presentation, please:

:pencil: __2f__ Open your [__YourName_GitHubExercise__] markdown file, and list, and briefly describe the relevant Taxonomy of AI domains, and subdomains for your chosen AI topic. Furthermore, write down the name and student number of a peer who is willing to help you with your presentation on Friday (e.g., help you navigate through the presentation slides, can make an additional video recording of the presentation, if necessary.). Commit the changes, and push the markdown file to your personal BUas repository.

:pencil: __2g__ Make a test video recording for the 'AI in Science Fiction' presentation, and upload it to your personal BUas Block A repository or Sharepoint.
