### 1. Introduction

For the second half of the day, you are going to explore the famous article Computing Machinery and Intelligence by Alan Turing (1950). This is the first, and definitely not the last, peer-reviewed article we are going to discuss in the programme. As a data professional it is important to stay up to date with new developments in the field. Furthermore, it is good to be familiar with the seminal works of AI. One way of doing so, is reviewing these scientific articles.

### 2. Article

The rise of artificial intelligence forces us to rethink what robots mean to society and what their role is to be. They are far better at arithmetic, but are they really as intelligent as us? What constitutes intelligence? And should we fear being replaced by these digital machines in the future? Alan Turing was the first to examine the relationship between human and digital machines.

In the article Computing Machinery and Intelligence (1950), Turing lays the foundation for modern day AI. He introduces an behavioural test, the Turing Test, and discusses some objections raised in relation to this test. As a result of his contributions to the field, he also called one of the 'founding fathers of AI'.

You will need to finish the material on Alan Turing by Friday the 10th of September. Make sure to plan wisely! During the DataLab 2, we will discuss Turing's article (and how to read these texts), and perform the Turing Test.

Tip: if you are having difficulties reading the mathematical equations or understanding the main concept of a text, try to look for additional information online. YouTube, StackOverfow, Quora, and Medium are examples of webpages that can help you in analyzing (scientific) articles.
