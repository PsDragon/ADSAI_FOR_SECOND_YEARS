## __Turing Test & Chatbots (2): Discussion & Turing Test__
\
<img src="./images/datalab_banner.jpg" alt="Books banner" width="600"/>

### 1. Introduction

In today's DataLab session, we will discuss the article Computation Machinery and Intelligence, and perform an experiment called the Turing Test.

Before/after the workshop you have time to work on the independent study material or creative brief, and/or ask the lecturers for feedback.

***

### 2. Workshop

The workshop consists of two parts: class discussing on the article, and the Turing Test (timeslot: 13:30 - 16:00).

When conducting the Turing Test, we will make use of the chatbots that were found online by you, and/or your fellow students.

#### 2.1 Discussion

#### 2.2 What are chatbots?

Chatbots, also referred to as conversational agents, are software applications that mimic human behavior (i.e. written or spoken speech) with the means to stimulate an interaction with a real person. If you have ever used an customer service live chat, you probably have interacted with such an conversational agent. It is estimated that by 2022, 75% to 90% of customer service inquiries are processed by bots operating on conversational AI technology (CNBC, May 9, 2017). It is fair to say, chatbots are here to stay.

*Video 3. Chatbots and virtual agents by Angela Wick.*

__2.2b__ Find a general purpose/universal chatbot that is accessible via a weblink, and answer the following questions:

- When was it created?
- Who created it?
- Why was it created?

It is important to include evidence of your findings (e.g. webpage link of chatbot, newspaper article, academic journal article etc.).

Example: [Cleverbot](https://www.cleverbot.com/) (Carpenter, 1997).

__2.2c__ The Loebner Prize is an annual competition where AI researchers try to convince a group of 'judges'/interrogators that their conversational bots are  human by answering set of questions (i.e. Turing Test). Can you list, and describe any other competitions in the field of AI?

#### 2.3  Strategy

Before we conduct the Turing Test, we need to devise a strategy to convince the 'judges'/interrogators that our chatbot is not a machine but a real human being. Together with your fellow group members you are going to develop such a strategy by drawing up a setting, and its corresponding conditions and questions. After the experiment, we will find out which group passed the test, and which group failed the test.

__2.3c__ How to tell the difference between a robot and a human?

Can a robot:

- be creative?
- gossip?
- fall in love?
- tell a joke?
- have empathy?
- cause annoyance?

If answered with 'no', to what extent do you think robots will be able to his in the future?

Questions to think about:
- What characterizes us as being human?
- How would you define intelligence
- Can a machine/robot/computer be considered intelligent?
- Can a machine/robot/computer think for itself?

__2.3b__ Devise a strategy to fool the 'judges'/interrogators. Incorporate the following elements:

- Setting (e.g. discussion between two students during a political theory class)
- Conditions (e.g. show sense of morality)
- Questions (e.g. 'I have very controversial views on politics, on democracy in particular. Do you think Iâ€™m a bad person for preferring a benevolent dictatorship?')
