## __Philosophy AI__

Today, you will start your journey into the wonderful world of Artificial Intelligence :rainbow: :computer: During the first independent study day, you will dive into the foundational concepts of AI by examining its philosophy. In addition, you will receive instruction on how to work with your Learning and Work Log. By the end of this day, having completed the relevant readings and activities listed in the study material, you should be well prepared for DataLab 1.

We advise you to start early with the independent study exercises because we will cover quite a bit of material today!

Make sure to hand in your Preparation for DataLab 1, Week 1 exercises by the end of the day (Mandatory!). For the time being, you can upload it to your Microsoft Teams environment. For details on staff availability, see [Project Brief](https://adsai.buas.nl/Year1/BlockA/).

## Learning objectives

1. Define the term 'artificial intelligence', 'weak AI', and 'strong AI'
2. Provide examples of real-life and/or fictional AI applications
3. Describe the procedure of the 'Chinese Room Experiment', and explain its objective
4. Appropriately match the philosophy of AI terms to the corresponding philosophy of AI matrix quadrants

## 1) Foundations of AI

### 1.1 What is artificial intelligence?

Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a rapid rise in popularity. Research into the field of AI is rocketing, and an increasing number of companies are incorporating AI technologies into their daily business operations. But, what does AI constitute?

__1.1a__ Watch the TEDx talk 'Understanding Artificial Intelligence and Its Future' by Neil Nie.

*Video 1. TEDx talk 'Understanding Artificial Intelligence and Its Future' by Neil Nie.*

__1.1b__ How would you define 'artificial intelligence'?

__1.1c__ Give three examples of AI applications. You can choose real-life examples, but also examples from popular culture (e.g., movies, books, video games etc.).

### 1.2 Philosophy of artificial intelligence

In this section, you will be made familiar with the various definitions of AI, and its related fields (e.g., cognitive science). The information required to complete this section successfully, can (to a greater extent) be found in the book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Russell and Norvig (2021)<sup>[1](#footnote_1)</sup>. You will be using this specific book throughout the program.

*Figure 1. Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Russell and Norvig, 2021).*

You can purchase the book or borrow it from BUas' library. The library currently has three copies available.

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #8a6d3b;; background-color: #fcf8e3; border-color: #faebcc;">
Tip: Incorporate some screen-free time in your schedule by reading a paper copy of a book/article etc. instead of a digital one. Your eyes will thank me later.
</div>

__1.2a__ Read the first two sub-chapters of the book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Russell and Norvig (2021) (p.19-35).

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #8a6d3b;; background-color: #fcf8e3; border-color: #faebcc;">
Tip: If you cannot find the answer to a question in the provided literature, try to look for an answer online.
</div>

__1.2b__ Define the following terms: 'weak AI', and 'strong AI'.

__1.2c__ If you have not taken a coffee break yet, take one right now (with your fellow students via Microsoft Teams)! Unlike computers, humans are only able to maintain true focus for around 45 minutes. If you are experiencing some difficulties concentrating, check out the [Pomodoro technique](https://pomofocus.io/).

__1.2d__ What is the 'Chinese room experiment'? Describe its procedure.

__1.2e__ What is the 'Chinese room experiment' supposed to show? Select the correct statement, and elaborate on your choice:

a) Computers are not yet able to simulate the human ability to understand
\
b) Understanding involves more than the ability to formally reproduce appropriate outputs
\
c) It is only possible for systems to demonstrate understanding
\
d) No machine can demonstrate genuine understanding

__2f__ Connect the Post It notes (Fig 2.) to the relevant quadrant in the philosophy matrix (Fig 3.). For example, A = 1, 2, and  B = 3, 4, 5 etc. Elaborate on your choices.

__1.2g__ After completing the readings and exercises of this section, would you provide the same answer to exercise 1.1b? Explain your answer.
