## DataLab 2: Presenting

In today's DataLab session, we will focus on strengthening our presentation skills. As a data professional, it is paramount that you can communicate your findings effectively:

> You can be the best data scientist — if you can't present your findings in a meaningful, engaging and memorable way — you won't make any impact. Simple as that. I mean, you don't have to be the next Steve Jobs… but you have to be a good enough presenter to let everyone in management understand the key takeaways of your data projects ([Source](https://data36.com/soft-skills-data-scientist/)).

To prepare you for the informative speech, i.e., the presentation 'AI in Science Fiction', we created a couple of in-class exercises and a workshop. Because, we all know:

These exercises will, among others, help you structure your speech and reduce some of the stage fright you might have.
