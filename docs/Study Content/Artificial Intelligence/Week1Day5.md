## DataLab 2: Presenting

In today's hybrid (online/offline) DataLab session, we will focus on strengthening our presentation skills. As a data professional, it is paramount that you can communicate your findings effectively:

> You can be the best data scientist — if you can't present your findings in a meaningful, engaging and memorable way — you won't make any impact. Simple as that. I mean, you don't have to be the next Steve Jobs… but you have to be a good enough presenter to let everyone in management understand the key takeaways of your data projects ([Source](https://data36.com/soft-skills-data-scientist/)).

To prepare you for the informative speech, i.e., the presentation 'AI in Science Fiction', we created a couple of exercises. Because, we all know:

*Figure 1. Sad, but true...*

These exercises will, among others, help you structure your speech and reduce some of the stage fright you might have. Lastly, we kindly ask you to turn on your camera during the online Microsoft Team meeting(s).
