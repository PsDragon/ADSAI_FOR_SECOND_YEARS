## DataLab 2: Presenting

In today's DataLab session, we will focus on strengthening our presentation skills. As a data professional, it is paramount that you can communicate your findings effectively:

> You can be the best data scientist — if you can't present your findings in a meaningful, engaging and memorable way — you won't make any impact. Simple as that. I mean, you don't have to be the next Steve Jobs… but you have to be a good enough presenter to let everyone in management understand the key takeaways of your data projects ([Source](https://data36.com/soft-skills-data-scientist/)).

To prepare you for the informative speech, i.e., the presentation 'AI in Science Fiction', we created a couple of in-class exercises. Because, we all know:

These exercises will, among others, help you structure your speech and reduce some of the stage fright you might have.

__2.1d__ Prepare a 5-minute informative speech where you present your history of AI 'milestone':
  - Create an outline for your presentation
  - Think about the tool(s) that you would like to use for your presentation (e.g. PowerPoint, whiteboard etc.)
  - Practice your presentation (this includes timing it!)

> Data-driven organization. You’ve likely heard this buzz phrase hundreds of times. But what does it really mean? And who are people who make data useful? ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5hLUknIi5c)).

*Video 2. Roles in Data Science Teams by AltexSoft.*

Each Friday, you will have the chance to familiarise yourself with the different roles that constitute a professional data team. This week focuses on the data scientist.

### 3.1 Data scientist

__3.1a__ Find out what a typical work day looks like for a data scientist (e.g., daily tasks, and related skills, etc.).

__3.1b__ Create an infographic where you display your findings of exercise 3.1a. You can use Google's [Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/) or a simple piece of paper for your infographic. Export/import your drawing to PNG, and upload it to your GitHub repository.
