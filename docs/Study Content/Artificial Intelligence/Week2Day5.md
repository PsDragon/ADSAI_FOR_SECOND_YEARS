## DataLab 2: Feedback


In today's DataLab session, we will focus on strengthening our feedback skills, which will help us identify and develop each other's strengths and weaknesses. 

To prepare you for the informative speech, i.e., the presentation 'AI in Science Fiction', we created a couple of in-class exercises. These will, among others, help you to provide constructive feedback to your peers during the presentation. 

## Learning objectives

1. List, and describe the feedback types, and models presented in the article How to give and receive feedback effectively by Hardavell et al., (2017)
2. Provide constructive feedback (to a peer) by deploying the hamburger/sandwich, and Pendleton feedback model 
3. Describe the main tasks, skills, and responsibilities of a data/ML engineer

## Questions or issues?

If you have questions or issues regarding the course material, please fill out the 'How Can We Help?' form under the section ['Ask me anything'](https://adsai.buas.nl/Contact%20Us/). A member of our teaching staff will respond as soon as possible.

***

## 1) Q&A and Standup

__1a__ Ask questions regarding the independent study material.

__1b__ Answer the following questions:

- What did I work on yesterday (includes DataLab Preparation!)?
- What am I working on today?
- What issues are blocking me?

***

## 2) How to give, and receive feedback?

__2a__ Read the article [How to give and receive feedback effectively](https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/breathe/13/4/327.full.pdf) by Hardavell et al., (2017). Although originally written for healthcare professionals, it is still relevant for us, ADS&AI students,  because it provides general guidelines on how to effectively provide, and receive feedback.   

__2b__ List, and describe the types of feedback, and models presented in the article How to give and receive feedback effectively by Hardavell et al., (2017). Write your answer down. 

__2c__ Complete one of the following courses on the topic of feedback: 

- [Using Feedback to Drive Performance: Everything is feedback](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/using-feedback-to-drive-performance/everything-is-feedback?autoplay=true&u=36359204) (LinkedIn Learning course, Amber Vanderburg and Madecraft)

- [Using Feedback to Drive Performance: Everything is feedback](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/using-feedback-to-drive-performance/everything-is-feedback?autoplay=true&u=36359204) (LinkedIn Learning course, Amber Vanderburg and Madecraft)

- [Giving Helpful Feedback, Week 1:Introduction to Giving Helpful Feedback and Positive Feedback](https://www.coursera.org/learn/feedback#syllabus) (Coursera course, Tracy Jennings)

__2b__ Watch the video below, and provide feedback to the presenter according to the sandwich/hamburger model. List the feedback, and explain your approach.

*Video 1. Undergraduate Students Unwittingly Subjected to World's Worst Research Presentation.*

__2e__ Compare your answer to exercise 2b with the feedback given by two of your peers. Is the feedback similar, or does it differ across peers? Elaborate on your findings. 

__2f__ Watch the video 'Run, hide, or say thank you: when faced with feedback, what do you do?' by Joy Mayer. Summarize the main points presented in the video (Maximum of 150 words).

*Video 2. 'Run, hide, or say thank you: when faced with feedback, what do you do?'*

__2g__ Team up with a peer, and provide feedback on each others work (Yesterday's DataLab preparation exercise) using the Pendleton model: 

__1. What did you do well?__

*Peer 1 (mentee) comments on what they did well - get them to describe these actions.*

__2. What I thought you did well?__

*Peer 2 (mentor) may concur with peer 1, and add additional comments on what peer 1 (mentee) did well.*

__3. What could you have done better?__

*Peer 1 (mentee) comments on how they could improve.*

__4. What I think you could have done better?__

*Peer 2 (mentor) may concur with peer 1, and adds additional comments on how they can improve.*  

__2h__ In the bi-weekly formative feedback sessions between student and mentor, the teaching staff members deploy various feedback methods (e.g., the Pendleton model). Think about how you, as a student, can prepare for such as session. Write your findings down.

## 2) Creative Brief: Minority Report (6)

The goal of this DataLab is to get familiar with various feedback methods. During the 'AI in Science Fiction' presentation you will be asked to provide constructive feedback to your peers. By the end of the day, try to list at least one element, related to the presentation, you want to receive feedback on. Furthermore, read through the peer feedback [template]('./documents/AnonymousPeerReviewForm.pdf'), which we will use during the 'AI in Science Fiction' presentation.

## 3) A Day in a life of ... (Optional)

Each Friday, you will have the chance to familiarise yourself with the different roles that constitute a professional data team. This week focuses on the data engineer.

### 3.1 Data/ML engineer

__3.1a__ Find out what a typical work day looks like for a data/ML engineer (e.g., daily tasks, and related skills, etc.).

Note: The Bronze Challenge for Block A is creating an infographic that provides an overview of the different roles that constitute a professional data team.
