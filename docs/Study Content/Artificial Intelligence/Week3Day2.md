*Video 1. TEDx talk 'The era of blind faith in big data must end' by Cathy O'Neill*

__1c__ In the video, she makes the following statement: 'Algorithms are opinions embedded in code'. What do you think she means with this statement, and what are the possible implications that could arise from it? Explain your answer.

__1d__ Read the module <a href="./documents/IntroToDataEthicsModule1.pdf">Introduction to Data Ethics</a>, and subsequently complete the exercises. Discuss your findings with a peer. Remember: There are no right or wrong answers here because many of the questions are open-ended, asking for personal reflection on values and professional goals, not factual assertions.

## 2) Applied data ethics 

__2a__ In the article [How to make a chatbot that isn't racist or sexist](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/23/1011116/chatbot-gpt3-openai-facebook-google-safety-fix-racist-sexist-language-ai/) Will Douglas Heaven presents three approaches to making chatbots safe for public use. List, and briefly describe these approaches, and explain why it is so difficult to stop a language model from generating offensive texts. Write your answer down.

For details on GPT-3, see the video and article:

__2b__ Find three newspaper articles on a risk and/or benefit associated with a domain and subdomain of AI (e.g., perception, computer vision, planning, natural language processing, searching, etc.), and fill in the table below:

__Example:__ [China's hi-tech war on its Muslim minority](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/apr/11/china-hi-tech-war-on-muslim-minority-xinjiang-uighurs-surveillance-face-recognition)

|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Chinese government  | Surveillance cameras equipped with facial recognition software  | Perception, computer vision, learning, and machine learning  | These AI technologies facilitate the prosecution of Uighurs by the Chinese government      |
| 2.    |   |   |   |   |
| 3.   |   |   |   |   |
