__Tips:__

- Time your presentation
- Create [cue cards](https://www.hema.nl/feest/wenskaarten-uitnodigingen/correspondentiekaarten-a6---50-stuks-14176310.html) for your presentation notes
- Do not discuss the complete plot of Minority Report in your presentation
- Elaborate on the statements you make in the presentation. For example, 'My [AI topic] can be linked to [Taxonomy of AI domain(s), and subdomain(s)], because [Explanation]'
- Use multiple sources to back your arguments with

__How do I provide evidence for ILO 3.1?__

To provide evidence for ILO 3.1, you must explain why you meet a certain grading criterion. For example, to meet the criterion of 'Insufficient', you also have to provide proof of meeting the previous criteria, - i.e.,'Poor'.

*Figure 2. Example of ILO section in the Learning Log by Lisa.*

As evidence of meeting the criteria of ILO 3.1, you can use the video recording of your presentation and the presentation slides (e.g., PowerPoint):

- Poor: My presentation took 6:32 minutes, see my video recording.  

- Insufficient: I was able to identify, and describe an AI topic (i.e., military robot) within the movie Minority Report, see minutes 1:45 - 2:32 of the video recording and slide 1 of my presentation. Additionally, I was able to connect my [AI topic] to the [Taxonomy of AI domain(s), and subdomain(s)], see minutes 3:00 - 4:25 of the video recording and slides 2-3 of my presentation. 

You can find the [video recording](), and [slides]() of my presentation on my personal BUas [repository]().
