### 1. Introduction

In this DataLab session, you are going to load, clean, and/or transform the youth care data in Power BI.

If you have not finished the Microsoft tutorial modules and corresponding lab exercises, make sure to finish them before you start working on the client's youth care dataset.   

***

### 2. Data wrangling

__2a__ Load the .pbix file named [youth_care](INSERT LINK), which contains the client's youth care dataset, in Power BI.

__2b__ Apply the knowledge you have gained, through completing the Microsoft tutorial modules and lab exercises, on the youth care dataset.

### 3. Creating your own layout in Power BI

What is user experience design (UX)? And why is it important to use UX principles when building a dashboard report?

__3a__ Watch the YouTube video 'Don Norman: The term "UX"', where Don Norman shares his thoughts on the origin of the term UX and how we should and should not use the term.

In his blog on UsabilityGeek, Justin Mifsud explains why it is important to make data user-friendly:

>If the designer fails to make data user-friendly, then the user consuming such data will be impeded from extracting the meaning underlying the graphics, numbers or text. Worse still, the user will end up sifting mindlessly through such data, trying to make sense of it â€“ not much different than they would have done had they been presented with raw data. Therefore, proper information visualisation leads to fast and accurate data consumption, which in turn can be used to make comparisons, draw conclusions and take decisions.
A crucial mantra to keep in mind is that while technology has rapidly evolved, this has not been met with a parallel evolution of the human being. In this regard, the dashboard designer must understand and support the nature and limitations of human perception (Mifsud, Dashboard design user experience guidelines, n.d.).

__3a__ Explore the website of the municipality of Oosterhout, and take a closer look at their corporate design (e.g. colours, logo etc.).

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #8a6d3b;; background-color: #fcf8e3; border-color: #faebcc;">
Tip: When you press the f12 key on a website, your browser opens the Developers Console. In most browsers, this will contain several tools that allows you to: identify the elements and their styles, see loaded resources, check memory consumption and rendering etc.

__3b__ Design a layout for the client's youth care Power BI dashboard, see the article [Creating Power BI layouts](https://thesqlgirl.com/2018/09/10/creating-powerbi-layouts/).

__3c__ Create a document that contains a selection of meta information of the layout you created for exercise 4b (e.g. font, colour etc.).
