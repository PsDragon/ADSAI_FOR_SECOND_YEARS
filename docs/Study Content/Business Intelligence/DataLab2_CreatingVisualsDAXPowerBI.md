### 1. Introduction

In this DataLab session, you are going to practice with writing DAX functions. Furthermore, you will have time to start creating visualizations with the youth care data in Power BI.

***

### 2. DAX

__2a__ Complete ```Module 5 - Create Model Calculations using DAX in Power BI``` (Part 1 & 2) lab exercise, which you can find [here](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/DA-100-Analyzing-Data-with-Power-BI/).

### 3. Visualizations in Power BI

It can be difficult to choose a suitable chart to represent (a subset of) your data. From experience I can tell you that an average data science/business intelligence/artificial intelligence project involves quite some trail and error (one of the reasons that makes our work so much fun, if you ask me :nerd_face:). Nevertheless, a solid theoretical background (e.g. in fields such as statistics, ML, UX design etc.) can give you the edge over a data professional that lacks such a foundation. In practice, it can be the difference between delivering an 'ok' dashboard or a dashboard that conveys a compelling data story to a client.

Tip: Thursday's independent study day material focused on creating visualizations. Want a refresher of the different visuals that are available in Power BI? Read Microsoft's <a href="( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-visualization-types-for-reports-and-q-and-a">Visualization types in Power BI</a> article.

__3a__ Apply the knowledge you have gained, through completing the Microsoft tutorial modules and lab exercises, on the youth care dataset.
