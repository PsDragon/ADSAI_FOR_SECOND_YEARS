### 1. Introduction

In this DataLab session, you have time to put the finishing touches on your dashboard report. Try to finish the layout, visualizations for the descriptive statistics etc. by the end of this week. In Week 5, you will start with the ML learning section of the Project Brief. Here, you will be asked, among others, to design, train and evaluate a ML model. The results of the ML model need to be included into your dashboard report in Power BI.
