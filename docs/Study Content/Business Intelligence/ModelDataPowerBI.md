### 1. Introduction

In the second independent study day of Week 3, you will be made familiar with various data modeling techniques in Power BI. For example:

>You will explore Power Query as you learn to extract data from different data sources and choose a storage mode and connectivity type. You will learn to profile, clean, and load data into Power BI in preparation for modeling your data (Microsoft Certified: Data Analyst Associate, Prepare data for analysis).

***

### 2. Creating a data model & Writing DAX function in Power BI

> Success with Power BI begins with a great data model. In this module, you will learn how to design a data model that is intuitive, high-performing, and simple to maintain. You will learn about using DAX language to create measures. Those measures will help you create a wide variety of analytic solutions. Additionally, youâ€™ll learn how to improve performance with your Power Query data retrieval tasks.
