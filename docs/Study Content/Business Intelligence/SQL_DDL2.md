### 1. Introduction

With today's independent study material you are going to deepen your knowledge on relational database design. For example, you will learn to compare and implement various types of database relationships (e.g. One-to-one, many-to-one etc.). Furthermore, you will learn to correctly deploy DDL related SQL clauses such as PRIMARY KEY, and FOREING KEY.
