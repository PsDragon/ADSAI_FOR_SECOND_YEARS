### Introduction

The focus of this week is on the second phase of the CRISP-DM process, which deals with __*Data Understanding and Preparation*__. To be more specific, our main goal will be to, __*individually*__, examine the datasets that we will be using for the project.

By conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we will be able to gain a better understanding of the data and detect any potential data quality problems that we might have to deal with during the project. Moreover, this will assist you and your team members in developing data-driven solutions to the issues presented by the municipality.

The knowledge module, __*Data Management and Analysis with PostgreSQL and Python*__, is divided into four use-cases, which are described in the following sections. Each use-case is related to a criteria of ILO 5:

> __5.0 Data Understanding  and Preparation__ <br>
The student is able to collect, combine, and explore the data. Further, they can assess data quality, and provide recommendations to improve the data management strategy. 

The criteria 'Poor', which is about clearly evidencing your individual contributions, is not included as a separate use-case, because it is assumed that you will be able to complete this without any additional instructions. However, if you are struggling with the use-cases, you can always ask the teaching staff for help.

## Use-cases

Here is a table of the use-cases and their description.

| Use-Case | Description | Dataset | Week | Individual/Team
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Select, combine, and preproccess the data | All | Weeks 3-8 | Individual/Team 
| 2 | Describe, and explore the data | Selected dataset(s) | Week 3 | Individual
| 3 | Assess the quality of the data | Selected dataset(s) | Week 3 | Individual
| 4 | Propose improvements to the data management strategy | N.A. | Week 3-8 | Team

:bell: Before we start, please make sure you have read the sections on Deliverables and Plagiarism you can find in the bottom of this page.

**Let's get started: Keep the coffee flowing and the music playing!**

:thumbsup: :headphones: :coffee:

## Use-case 1: Select, combine, and preproccess the data

In this use-case, which is related to the 'Insufficient' criteria of ILO 5, you will be asked to select, combine, and preproccess the data. For example, you will need to select the relevant datasets for your business problem, and combine them into a single dataset and/or database. In addition, you will also need to preproccess the data in such a way that it is ready for analysis. 

__To solve this use-case, you will need to:__

- [ ] Define your research questions: Start by defining some research questions that you could answer with the data. This will help you to determine what data you need to collect and how you need to preprocess it.
- [ ] Gather the data: Collect relevant data from various sources such as databases, APIs, or CSV files. Ensure that the data is in a format that can be easily processed.
- [ ] Combine the data: Merge data from different sources if necessary. Ensure that the keys for merging are consistent across all datasets.

## Use-case 2: Describe, and explore the data 

In this use-case, which is related to the 'Sufficient' criteria of ILO 5, you will be asked to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which will help you to get a better understanding of your data, identify patterns, detect outliers, and gain insights that can guide further analysis :sunglasses:. 

__To solve this use-case, you will need to:__

- [ ] Get to know your data: Start by looking at the data's structure, size, and format. Check for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- [ ] Visualize the data: Use charts, histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize the data and identify any trends or patterns.
- [ ] Explore relationships: Look for correlations and relationships between different variables. This can be done through scatter plots or correlation matrices.
- [ ] Document findings: Keep track of any interesting findings or insights you discover during the analysis process. This documentation will be helpful in communicating your findings to others.


## Use-case 3: Assess the quality of the data

In this use-case, which is related to the 'Good' criteria of ILO ..., you will be asked to ...

__To solve this use-case, you will need to:__

- [ ] Check for data quality issues: Look for inconsistencies, data entry errors, or any other data quality issues that may affect the analysis.

## Use-case 4: Propose improvements to the data management strategy

In this use-case, which is related to the 'Excellent' criteria of ILO ..., you will be asked to ...

If you have come this far, you have now completed the Creative Brief section for the knowledge module ... Congratulations! :tada: :tada: :tada:

:trophy: If you still have time remaining, please have a look at the Medal Challenges!

## Deliverables

If you are done with the use-cases, you can move on to documentation, ensure that you have saved and committed all your work to Github. Documentation is a very important part of the project, and you will need to ensure that you have a ...

## Plagiarism

Please note that plagiarism is a serious offense. You are encouraged to use the internet to help you with your analyses, but you must ensure that you cite your sources. However, if your code, and/or accompanied explanation(s) (e.g., inline-comments, texts in markdown block, etc.), exactly resembles the code, and/or explanation(s) of another student, you will be reported to the Board of Examiners. You are encouraged to discuss the use-cases with your peers, but you must ensure that you write your own code, and provide your own explanation(s). If you are unsure about whether your code, and/or explanation(s) are similar to another student's code, and or explanation(s), please ask your mentor to review your work.
