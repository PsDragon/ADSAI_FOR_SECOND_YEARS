# Market Research for Product development & Target audience analysis 

Research plays a critical role in the product development process. It enables you to verify your ideas with facts and statistics, and ensure your product will appeal to customers, be competitive in the market, and have the appropriate features, among other things. Without researching beforehand, your product may not achieve its maximum potential.

In the first part of today's independent study day, you will learn how to conduct exploratory research to design your application.  

In the second part of today's independent study day you will focus on identifying your Target audience.

## Homework exercises

1. Using the knowledge acquired by reading today's independent study day material, conduct simple market research by answering the following questions:

•   What classifier product/product feature could make customers’ lives easier?​

•	How can I improve my customers' experience?

•	What problem can I alleviate for my customers?

•	What are the unmet needs of my customers?

•	Are current products on the market meeting customers' expectations? If not, what is lacking?

In case you are not able to find some of the information, feel free to skip it. The main goal of this exercise is to identify the gap in the market that your application can fill in.

## Overall market research

Before proceeding with developing your product, it's essential to conduct some initial research to guide your direction. The first step is to identify the customer pain points you aim to address. To do this, consider the following questions:

•	How can I improve my customers' experience?

•	What problem can I alleviate for my customers?

•	What are the unmet needs of my customers?

•	Are current products on the market meeting customers' expectations? If not, what is lacking?

By answering these questions, you can gain a better understanding of what product or feature would make customers' lives easier and what gaps currently exist in the market. This exploratory research will help you make informed decisions about what direction to take with your new product.
Gathering information about what customers might want in a completely new product can be a bit challenging, as they may not have an existing frame of reference. However, there are a few methods that can be employed:

Gathering information about what customers might want in a completely new product can be a bit challenging, as they may not have an existing frame of reference. However, there are a few methods that can be employed:

•	Utilize online surveys

Use survey tools to gather information about customer needs, pain points, and potential solutions for a new product. You can also ask them about what they would like to see in a product that doesn't currently exist.

•	Monitor social media.

Check social media accounts of similar products/industries to monitor conversations about similar products or related topics, to identify common issues and potential solutions for a new product.

•	Desk research for product development

Desk research, also known as secondary research, is a type of research that uses existing data and resources to gather information about a specific topic or problem. In product development, desk research is used to gather information about the market, industry, and competition. This type of research allows you to gain a better understanding of the industry landscape, identify trends and gaps in the market, and understand the needs and preferences of your target customers.

Desk research methods for product development may include:

•	Analysing industry reports and statistics

•	Reviewing literature and publications related to the industry or product category

•	Researching competitor's products, pricing

•	Examining customer reviews and feedback

•	Analysing data from online marketplaces and social media

•	Searching for patent and trademark information

Desk research is a cost-effective and efficient way to gather information about a product or market, but it is important to remember that it has its limitations, as the data may not be current or may not represent the whole market. Therefore, it should be combined with primary research methods (such as surveys, interviews, or focus groups) to gain a more complete understanding of the market and customers.

## Target audience analysis

After you understand the overall needs and wants of your market, you need to dive a bit deeper to create a product that delivers value to customers. For this purpose, a company must identify the specific group of customers it aims to serve. This group, known as the target market, is the consumer profile that the product is designed for. It is crucial to identify the target market early in the product development process so that the product concept can be tailored to meet the needs of that specific group. The process of identifying a target market involves two steps: segmenting the market and targeting a specific group within that market. This will be the focus of the second section of today's independent study materials.

## Segmentation

Market segmentation is a commonly used marketing technique for attracting leads, but it can also be used in the development of new products. By segmenting customers, a business can identify potential buyers for a new product or service, and use this information to inform its market entry strategy. 

Customer segmentation can also be used to uncover new customer needs, which can then be used to develop new products that meet those needs. This approach is more data-driven and can help businesses overcome challenges in product development. With technology advancing rapidly, companies should adopt a customer-focused approach to product development, rather than launching a product and then trying to find customers for it. This method is also recommended for expanding or scaling existing products, as it allows the focus to be on a specific subset of customers. Customer segmentation is key to this approach, and it can give companies a competitive advantage when entering the market.
Market segmentation for a new product involves dividing a larger market into smaller groups of customers with similar needs and characteristics. This process allows a company to identify specific segments of the market that may be particularly interested in the new product. By understanding these segments, the company can tailor its product development, marketing, and distribution strategies to better meet the needs of those customers.

__The process of market segmentation for a new product typically involves several steps:__

Define the overall market: Identify the total market for the new product, including all potential customers.

•	Identify segments: Divide the overall market into smaller segments based on characteristics such as demographics, psychographics, or behavior.

•	Evaluate segments: Analyze each segment to determine its size, growth potential, and overall attractiveness as a target market for the new product.

•	Select target segments: Choose one or more segments that appear to be the most promising for the new product based on the evaluation.

By identifying and targeting specific segments of the market, a company can increase the chances of success for a new product by tailoring it to the specific needs and preferences of those customers.

2.	What are benefits and drawbacks of market segmentation?

3.	 How does Gymshark segments their market and why is it a good way to segment a market?

**The information below summarizes the theory behind market segmentation.**

There are several different ways to segment a market, including:

•	Demographic segmentation: Dividing the market based on characteristics such as age, gender, income, and education level.

•	Geographic segmentation: Dividing the market based on geographic location, such as region, city, or climate.

•	Psychographic segmentation: Dividing the market based on lifestyle, personality, or values.

•	Behavioral segmentation: Dividing the market based on how customers interact with a product or service, such as purchase history, loyalty, or usage rate.

Business rarely limits their segmentation analysis to only one or a few variables. Rather, they often use multiple segmentation bases to identify better-defined target groups. 

## Targeting

Once a market has been segmented, a company can evaluate each segment to determine its size, growth potential, and overall attractiveness as a target market. The company can then select one or more segments to target with tailored products, services. By targeting specific segments of the market when developing new products or services, companies can increase the chances of success by creating products that are better suited to the needs and preferences of the target customers.

## Persona

Personas are fictional characters created by companies to represent real customers. Ideal customers are defined by buyer personas, including their daily routines, struggles, and decision-making processes.  A comprehensive profile of your target buyer will guide product design, indicate where to allocate resources, and ensure organizational unity.
Segmentation and personas are both components of the segmentation analysis. They are not separate research methods as perceived by some in the UX community. Segmentation involves identifying segments, while personas are just profiles describing those segments.
