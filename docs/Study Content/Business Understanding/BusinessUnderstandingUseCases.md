# __Use Cases: Business Understanding__

In **today's data lab**, we will work on the Business Understanding use-cases. Use-cases 1-2 (Topic: Market research and Target audience analysis ) are related to the independent study material of Week 1. Use case 3 (Topic: Disruptive technology risks) is related to the lecture provided during the DataLab week 7, Friday.

## Use-cases

It doesn't matter what you develop, it is important that your product delivers value to your end user. It is also important that your product doesn't cause any risks ( or minimum risks). Therefore the main focus of ILO 1.0 is to acquire knowledge on the development of the client oriented product and disruptive technology risks.  

In order to get a sufficient, you need to complete the entire use case 2, for good you need to finish step 1 of use case 3 and for excellent you are required to finish all the use cases. 

__Use case 1__

The main goal of the user case 1 is to conduct an overall market research in order to identify unmet needs among people in the market and find a way to full fill these needs by designing a computer vision application.

__To solve this use-case, you will need to:__

- [ ] Step 1

During the independent study day (link) you were asked to conduct simple market research by answering the following questions:

- [ ]	What classifier product/product feature could make customers’ lives easier?

- [ ] How can I improve my customers' experience?

- [ ] What problem can I alleviate for my customers?

- [ ] What are the unmet needs of my customers?

- [ ] Are current products on the market meeting customers' expectations? If not, what is lacking?


In case you didn’t answer these questions, please do. In case you did then you can begin with the step 2 of the user case 1.

- [ ] Step 2

Based on gathered knowledge from the conducted market research, explain your first idea for a project proposal for an application.  

- [ ] Step 3

Start filling in the AI Canvas.

__Use case 2__

The main goal of the use case 2 is to identify needs and wants of your target market to design the application that creates a value for your target audience specifically. 

__To solve this use-case, you will need to:__

- [ ] Step 1 

Segment consumers interested in your application into group based on information provided during [the independent study day](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Business%20Understanding/BusinessUnderstanding%201.html#21-segmentation).

- [ ] Step 2

Evaluate each segment and pick your target.

- [ ] Step 3

Use the templated you have created for your persona to prepare for the DataLab and fill it in.
Within the persona, make sure to explain the value your application will create for your user.

- [ ] Step 4

- [ ] Adjust your project proposal for the computer vision application based on created persona. The adjusted project proposal should be based on the satisfaction of needs of your consumer which were identified during the creation of the persona. Personal features of your persona should be taken into consideration too. For example, if you find out that your end users not tech savvy and relatively old, you might propose to create a computer vision application that is extremely user friendly and self explanatory. Therefore you need to make your project proposal for the computer vision application as consumer oriented as possible, keepingin mind all the personal features and needs of your persona. 

- [ ] Explain the decision-making context of improving your project proposal for the computer vision application.

__Use case 3__

The main goal of the user case 3 is to assess disruptive technology risks associated with the project proposal for the computer vision application. 

__To solve this use-case, you will need to:__

- [ ] Step 1.

Attend the lecture on disruptive technologies and using __disruptive technology risks from the lecture slides__ identify/explain risks that applicable for your computer vision application.

- [ ] Step 2.
 
Address the disruptive technology risk in the project proposal for the application and complete the AI canvas.
