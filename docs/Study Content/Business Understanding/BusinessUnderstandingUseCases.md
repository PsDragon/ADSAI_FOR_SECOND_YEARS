# __Use-cases: Business Understanding__

In **today's data lab**, we will work on the Business Understanding use-cases. Use-cases 1 (Topic: Market research) and 2 (Topic: Target audience analysis) are related to the independent study material of Week 1. Use-case 3 (Topic: Disruptive technology risks) is related to the lecture provided during the DataLab week 7, Friday.
<!-- Maybe worthwile to tell them to keep iterating on their project proposal throughout the block as they keep building their model, doing XAI and designing their application? -->


## Use-cases

It doesn't matter what you develop, it is important that your product delivers value to your end user. It is also important that your product doesn't cause any risks (or minimal risks). Therefore, the main focus of ILO 1.0 is to acquire knowledge on the development of the client-oriented product and the disruptive technology risks involved.  

In order to get a sufficient, you need to complete the entire use-case 2, for good you need to finish step 1 of use-case 3 and for excellent you are required to finish all the use-cases. 
<!-- Don't they also need to complete use-case 1 for a sufficient? Or where do they complete that for?-->

__Use-case 1__

The main goal of the use-case 1 is to conduct an overall market research in order to identify unmet needs among people in the market and find a way to fulfill these needs by designing a computer vision application.

__To solve this use-case, you will need to:__

- [ ] Step 1

During the independent study day (link) you were asked to conduct simple market research by answering the following questions:

- [ ]	What classifier product/product feature could make customers’ lives easier?

- [ ] How can I improve my customers' experience?

- [ ] What problem can I alleviate for my customers?

- [ ] What are the unmet needs of my customers?

- [ ] Are current products on the market meeting customers' expectations? If not, what is lacking?


In case you didn’t answer these questions, please do so now. In case you did then you can begin with the step 2 of the use-case 1.

- [ ] Step 2

Based on gathered knowledge from the conducted market research, explain your first idea for a project proposal for an application.  
<!-- Maybe here we can let them diverge: come up with multiple ideas for their project proposal but at least 1: https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Human-Centered%20Artificial%20Intelligence/Interaction_Information_Processing_Fundamentals.html#divergent---convergent-processes -->

- [ ] Step 3

Start filling in the AI Canvas. 
<!-- Where do they fill-in the AI Canvas? In their project proposal powerpoint template right? Maybe specify here where or how exactly -->

__Use-case 2__

The main goal of the use-case 2 is to identify needs and wants of your target market to design the application that creates a value for your target audience specifically. 

__To solve this use-case, you will need to:__

- [ ] Step 1 

Segment consumers interested in your application into groups based on information provided during [the independent study day](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Business%20Understanding/BusinessUnderstanding%201.html#21-segmentation).

- [ ] Step 2

Evaluate each segment and pick your target.

- [ ] Step 3

Use the template you have created for your persona to prepare for the DataLab and fill it in.
Within the persona, make sure to explain the value your application will create for your user.

- [ ] Step 4

    - [ ] Adjust your project proposal for the computer vision application based on created persona. The adjusted project proposal should be based on the satisfaction of needs of your consumer which were identified during the creation of the persona. Personal features of your persona should be taken into consideration too. For example, if you find out that your end-users are not tech-savvy and relatively old; you might propose to create a computer vision application that is extremely user-friendly and self-explanatory. Therefore, you need to make your project proposal for the computer vision application as consumer-oriented as possible, keeping in mind all the personal features and needs of your persona. 

    - [ ] Explain the decision-making context of improving your project proposal based on all 4 steps above.

<!-- Replace 'for the computer vision application' with 'based on all 4 steps above'. Or maybe 'based on your complete target audience research'? -->

__Use-case 3__

The main goal of the use-case 3 is to assess disruptive technology risks associated with the project proposal for your computer vision application. 

__To solve this use-case, you will need to:__

- [ ] Step 1.

    - Attend the lecture on disruptive technologies and, using __disruptive technology risks from the lecture slides__; identify/explain risks that applicable for your computer vision application.
    - identify/explain risks that applicable for your computer vision application.
<!-- Maybe mentoin the framework of taxonomy of distruptive technology risks; that they need to identify the type of risk. And maybe, instead of in step 2, already tell them to already fill the project proposal presentation template in straightaway? Or would you prefer them to first do it using their note file for example? -->


- [ ] Step 2.
 
Address the disruptive technology risk in the project proposal for the application and complete the AI canvas.
