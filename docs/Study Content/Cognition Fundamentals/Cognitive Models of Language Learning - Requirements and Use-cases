# 1. Cognitive Models of Language Learning - Requirements & Use-cases

<img src="./images/imsitu.jpg" alt="Imsitu dataset" width="800">

## Responsible AI

In **today's data lab**, we will work on the Cognitive Models of Language Learning use-cases. Use-case 1-5 are related to the independent study material of Week 4. Use case 6 (Topic: Computational models of language learning) is related to the medal challenges!

## Use-cases

Here is a table of the use-cases and their description.

| Use-Case | Description | ILO Criteria | Link
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Create a flowchart of auditory Perception | Poor & Sufficient | [clicky]()
| 2 | Create a flowchart for language acquisition | Poor & Sufficient | [clicky]()
| 3 | Recorded a flowchart walkthrough to demonstrate language acquisition in a simple scenario | Sufficient | [clicky]()
| 4 | Recorded a flowchart walkthrough to demonstrate language acquisition for a dynamic scenario | Good | [clicky]()
| 5 | Compare both cognitive models with the transformer network architecture | Excellent | [clicky]()
| 6 | Operationalize your model to a computational model of language learning to demonstrate a language acquisition  | Medal Challenge | [clicky]()

:bell: Before we start, please make sure you have read the sections on [The final deliverables]() and [Plagiarism]() you can find in the bottom of this page.

**Let's get started: Keep the coffee flowing and the music playing!**

:thumbsup: :headphones: :coffee:

## Use-case 1: Create a flowchart of human auditory perception

Some high-level description


__To solve this use-case, you will need to:__
- [ ] Some step

Deliverable:
- Flowchart meeting the points above where the files is delivered as: .pptx, .pdf, .png, .docx, .jpeg, and .JPG. For other file extensions, contact the course instructor.

<br>

ILO Mapping Explained:
- Poor: flowchart of auditory perceptual proccesing accurately representents cognitive theory of auditory perception
- Insufficient: Input & output going into the model of  auditory perceptual proccessing accurately representents cognitive theory of auditory perception

## Use-case 6: Operationalize your model to a computational model of language learning to demonstrate a language acquisition 

:yellow_heart::raised_hands::dancer::snake::computer:

If you have come this far, you have now completed the creative brief section for the module Cognitive Models of Language Learning. Congratulations! :tada: :tada: :tada:

:trophy: If you still have time remaining, please have a look at the [Medal Challenges](). Essentially, you are going to create a transformer network which is going to train on a corpus of words to acquire it's meaning. We're then going to match this to the behavioural data; how the actual humans learned the words when hearing them; our validation set.
- You can find a full master thesis example [here](https://theses.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/123456789/8109/Huynh,_M.H._1.pdf?sequence=1)
- [Example word corpus to use]()

Deliverable:
- Juypter notebook with computational model of language learning
- Dataset
- Screenrecording (MS teams) which demonstrates that your model acquiring the same meaning as the human in your validation dataset


## The final deliverables

If you are done with the use-cases, you can make sure your evidence is all in order, ensure that you have saved and committed all your work to Github. You will need to ensure that you have your [flowcharts]() and [walthrough recording]() evideced according to the descriptions in the use-cases; note that you can use your notes to supplement your work. Additional requirements are stated below:
- [ ] Some requirements

## Plagiarism

Please note that plagiarism is a serious offense. You are encouraged to use the internet to help you with your analyses, but you must ensure that you cite your sources. However, if your code, and/or accompanied explanation(s) (e.g.,inline-comments, texts in markdown block, etc.), exactly resembles the code, and/or explanation(s) of another student, you will be reported to the board of examiners. You are encouraged to discuss the use-case with your peers, but you must ensure that you write your own code, and provide your own explanation(s). If you are unsure about whether your code, and/or explanation(s) are similar to another student's code, and or explanation(s), please ask your mentor to review your code, and/or other writings.
