**Let's get started: Keep the coffee flowing and the music playing!**

:thumbsup: :headphones: :coffee:


## Use-case 1: Create a flowchart of language acquisition and demonstrate the information processing for a simple scenario
Provide a *step-by-step* walkthrough using your flowchart:

Scenario description: Baby sees their mother directly in front and above her crib; both are in a well-lit room. The mother is repeating the same word over and over again: 'mama'. After every repetition, there are two possible outcomes:
1. The baby does not repeat the word (succesfully) or performs some other behaviour (e.g. smiling). The mother therefore repeats the word. <!--- (auditory cue, no positive or negative reinforcement learning) --->
2. The baby repeats the word succesfully (enough). In response the mother smiles and expresses auditory excitement. <!--- (auditory, visual and tactile cue; positive reinforcement learning) --->

You can assume that the baby and the mother both do not have any biological or psychological defects and represent the average human of their given category. You only have to describe the informational processing of the elements mentioned in the scenario description. 

### Learning Behaviour to Integrate
This scenario uses cognitive systems and processes we studied last block but it also integrates the material we studied with regards to the [auditory system](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Cognition%20Fundamentals/Auditory%20Perception%20&%20Learning.html) and [cognitive models of language learning](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Cognition%20Fundamentals/Cognitive%20Models%20of%20Language%20Learning.html). However, this scenario requires the integration of a type of a second type of learning behaviour we did not cover yet: mirror-neurons.

Mirror neurons are a type of neuron found in the brain that become active when an individual observes another individual performing the same action. If the individual performs that same action as the observed individual, the same neurons are activated. The discovery of mirror neurons has led to the development of the "mirror neuron theory," which proposes that these neurons play a key role in social cognition, empathy, and the ability to understand and imitate the actions of others. According to this theory, when an individual observes another person's actions, the mirror neurons in their brain fire in a way that allows them to simulate the observed action and understand its meaning.

Mirror neurons are found in several areas of the brain, including the premotor cortex and the inferior parietal lobule. These areas are involved in motor planning, control, and perception, suggesting that mirror neurons play a crucial role in linking the perception and action systems of the brain. 

Research on mirror neurons has focused on a wide range of behaviors, including language, empathy, and even the ability to experience emotions. For example, studies have shown that individuals with autism, who often have difficulty with social communication and empathy, may have differences in their mirror neuron systems compared to typically developing individuals. Mirror neurons are a fascinating area of research that have provided new insights into the brain mechanisms underlying social cognition and the ability to understand and interact with others. And the scenario above describes a simple situation where they would, slowly, be connected.

### Requirements
- Flowchart meeting able to handle the informational processing described in the points above where the files is delivered as: .pptx, .pdf, .png, .docx, .jpeg, and .jpg. For other file extensions, contact the course instructor.
- Recorded walkthrough (maximum of 10 minutes) in microsoft teams where you explain how the information is processed by the baby. First for step one (only once) and then for step 2. Make sure your flowchart walkthrough covers all the relevant input and output criteria; and how these inputs and output are covered in the environment and to which categories they belong (e.g. tactile cue). Only focus on the cues which are relevant for understanding the situational context.

### ILO Mapping Explained
- Poor: flowchart of auditory perceptual proccesing accurately representents cognitive theory of auditory perception and language acquisition.
- Insufficient: Input & output going into the model for acquiring the linguistic meaning of word is correctly identified.
- Sufficient: The entire model with all; A) it's components and B) the information forms (or types) at each step, is correct.



## Use-case 2: Create a flowchart of language acquisition and demonstrate the information processing for a complex scenario

Describe the auditory and visual perceptual processing of the child, and relate it to the child's acquisition of language.
## 1
Scenario description: 
1. A young child is located in a kitchen and sits before the TV, their mom is, audibly, cutting apples and singing to the righthand-side of the child. To the lefthand-side of the child lies a dark-brown german shephard dog; a puppy called Henry. The child is watching an educational children's cartoon on TV which depicts a field of grass under a sunny, unclouded sky. A brown labrador walks into the frame, facing the camera and barks hapily (800 Hertz). Henry barks happily (3000 Hertz) back as well, at which point the child looks at Henry, smiles and looks back at the TV. A beige golden retriever walking into the scene, turns to face the camera, also barking happily (1200 Hertz). Henry barks happily (3000 Hertz) back again, the child looks at Henry, smiles and looks back at the TV. The mother says 'Stop barking Henry', she walks, passing between the child and tv, up to Henry. The mother repeats 'Stop Henry' again, Henry stops barking but regardless the mother takes Henray by his collar and guides him through the backdoor on the righthand-side of the child. She returns to cutting the apples and the child to watching TV.
2. The 2 dogs on the TV start walking together over the grassy field. The dogs do not talk, only humans talk in this cartoon. The dogs suddenly stop running, start to look angy and start growling; both at their respective frequencies minus 300 Hertz, at  The cartoon switches to a shot of a tree with a squirrel in it which looks scared and squeaks (5000 Hertz). This child looks scared and start crying.
3. The mother stops cutting apples, turns, and walks towards the child saying 'aaaah sweetie'. The mother lifts the child, cuddles it and say 'here, here, come now, it's okay'.
4. The cartoon cuts to a shot of a young teenager running towards the dogs. The mother directs the gaze of the child towards the tv and says 'see, it's going to be okay.'. At which point, the teenager commands the dogs to stop by yelling 'stop!'. At which points the dogs stop and are grabbed by their collars and are taken away by teenager out of the shot. The mother says 'see, it's alright' and the child stops crying.


You can assume that the baby and the mother both do not have any biological or psychological defects and represent the average human of their given category. You only have to describe the informational processing of the elements mentioned in the scenario description. You only have to include visual and auditory cues for each step but can skip the tactile cues for all steps **except step 3**. If the frequency for a sound is given, you have to explain it to the appropriate sensory and perceptual depth. Only describe the details explicitly mentoined in the text.


### Requirements
- Flowchart meeting able to handle the informational processing described in the points above where the files is delivered as: .pptx, .pdf, .png, .docx, .jpeg, and .jpg. For other file extensions, contact the course instructor.
- Recorded walkthrough (maximum of 15 minutes) in microsoft teams where you explain how the information is processed by the baby. Specifically, describe the auditory and visual perceptual processing of the child, and relate it to the child's acquisition of language. Make sure your flowchart walkthrough covers all the relevant input and output criteria; and how these inputs and output are covered in the environment and to which categories they belong (e.g. tactile, visual or auditory cue). Only focus on the cues which are relevant for understanding the situational context. Tactile cues only need to be described in terms of direct learning effect.

### ILO Mapping Explained
This use-case builds on the same flowchart as use-case 1, and the good criteria are as always dependent on you achieving the previous assessment rubric, therefore for this use case you will also need to do the following to achieve the respective ILO's:
- Poor: flowchart of auditory perceptual proccesing accurately representents cognitive theory of auditory perception and language acquisition.
- Insufficient: Input & output going into the model for acquiring the linguistic meaning of word is correctly identified.
- Sufficient: The entire model with all; A) it's components and B) the information forms (or types) at each step, is correct.

Furthermore, you can achieve the following ILO criteria by:
- Good: Creating and demonstrating that your model flowchart for language acquisition can accomodate for for use-case 2 by being able to handle differentiating environmental conditions in the given use-case. 
- Excellent: Demonstrating the simmilarities and distictions between transformer networks used in state-of-the-art large language models and human cognitive system in the context of language aquisition & auditory perception. 



## The final deliverables

If you are done with the use-cases, you can make sure your evidence is all in order, ensure that you have saved and committed all your work to Github. You will need to ensure that you have your flowcharts and walthrough recording evideced in your learning log and uploaded to sharepoint; note that you can use your notes to supplement your work if you refer to it in your learning log. 


## Plagiarism

Please note that plagiarism is a serious offense. You are encouraged to use the internet to help you with your analyses, but you must ensure that you cite your sources. However, if your code, and/or accompanied explanation(s) (e.g.,inline-comments, texts in markdown block, etc.), exactly resembles the code, and/or explanation(s) of another student, you will be reported to the board of examiners. You are encouraged to discuss the use-case with your peers, but you must ensure that you write your own code, and provide your own explanation(s). If you are unsure about whether your code, and/or explanation(s) are similar to another student's code, and or explanation(s), please ask your mentor to review your code, and/or other writings.
