# Cognitive Models of Language Learning - Requirements & Use-cases

<img src="./images/imsitu.jpg" alt="Imsitu dataset" width="800">

In **today's data lab**, we will work on the Cognitive Models of Language Learning use-cases. Use-case 1 is related to the independent study material of Monday and Tuesday (week 3) whereas Use-case 2 is related to all indepdent study material.

## Use-cases

Here is a table of the use-cases and their description.

| Use-Case | Description | ILO Criteria |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Create a flowchart of language acquisition and demonstrate the information processing for a simple scenario | Poor - Sufficient |
| 2 | Create a flowchart of language acquisition and demonstrate the information processing for a complex scenario | Good & Excellent |


:bell: Before we start, please make sure you have read the sections on [The final deliverables](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Cognition%20Fundamentals/Cognitive%20Models%20of%20Language%20Learning%20-%20Requirements%20and%20Use-cases.html#the-final-deliverables) and [Plagiarism](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Cognition%20Fundamentals/Cognitive%20Models%20of%20Language%20Learning%20-%20Requirements%20and%20Use-cases.html#plagiarism) you can find in the bottom of this page.

**Let's get started: Keep the coffee flowing and the music playing!**

## Use-case 1: Create a flowchart of language acquisition and demonstrate the information processing for a simple scenario
Some high-level description


1. Pick a tweet from your dataset which is either a disaster or non-disaster tweet and rewrite it in your own words as if you were telling it to another person. Make sure to say it out loud so you can check whether it's actually something that makes sense as dialogue.
2. Take a look at your flowcharts from last time and figure X. image dataset and figure 1 below. Create a flowchart of figure 1. List down the objects that you are going to identify in the in the 'High-Level Vision' section of the flowchart.
2. Imagine that you are identifying the objects. What features/characteristics do you look out for yourself? How do you personally identify the object. List these down in the 'mid-Level Vision' section of the flowchart.
3. Fill in the rest of the flowchart using the following steps:
- Take a look at the lecture slides and provided literature below regarding human visual perception. Fill in the rest of the human cognitive vision system; specifically taking the input, visual perception proccesing steps and desired output in mind.

__To solve this use-case, you will need to:__
- [ ] Some step

Deliverable:
- Flowchart meeting the points above where the files is delivered as: .pptx, .pdf, .png, .docx, .jpeg, and .JPG. For other file extensions, contact the course instructor.

<br>

ILO Mapping Explained:
- Poor: flowchart of auditory perceptual proccesing accurately representents cognitive theory of auditory perception
- Insufficient: Input & output going into the model of  auditory perceptual proccessing accurately representents cognitive theory of auditory perception

## Use-case 2: Create a flowchart of language acquisition and demonstrate the information processing for a complex scenario

- Insufficient: Input & output going into the model of human language acquisition accurately representents cognitive theory of language acquisition

## The final deliverables

If you are done with the use-cases, you can make sure your evidence is all in order, ensure that you have saved and committed all your work to Github. You will need to ensure that you have your flowcharts and walthrough recording evideced in your learning log and uploaded to sharepoint; note that you can use your notes to supplement your work if you refer to it in your learning log. 


## Plagiarism

Please note that plagiarism is a serious offense. You are encouraged to use the internet to help you with your analyses, but you must ensure that you cite your sources. However, if your code, and/or accompanied explanation(s) (e.g.,inline-comments, texts in markdown block, etc.), exactly resembles the code, and/or explanation(s) of another student, you will be reported to the board of examiners. You are encouraged to discuss the use-case with your peers, but you must ensure that you write your own code, and provide your own explanation(s). If you are unsure about whether your code, and/or explanation(s) are similar to another student's code, and or explanation(s), please ask your mentor to review your code, and/or other writings.
