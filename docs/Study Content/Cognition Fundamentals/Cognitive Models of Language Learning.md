# Cognitive Models of Language Learning 

## What is it?
Human language acquisition refers to the process by which humans acquire the ability to communicate using language. This process typically begins in infancy and continues throughout childhood and adolescence. There are a few different theories about how language acquisition occurs, but most researchers agree that it involves both innate biological factors and environmental factors such as exposure to language and social interactions. 

At birth, infants are already equipped with the ability to distinguish between different speech sounds, and over time they learn to recognize and produce the sounds used in their native language(s). This process is facilitated by exposure to language in the environment, as well as by the social interactions and feedback provided by caregivers and other speakers.

As children continue to develop, they begin to learn the rules of grammar and syntax, as well as the meaning of words and how they can be combined to form complex sentences. This process is also heavily influenced by social and environmental factors, such as the availability of educational resources and opportunities for practice and feedback; reinforcement learning.

Human language acquisition has been studied for centuries but using computational modeling; the cognitive approach, for such studies is a relatively recent trend. Computational approaches to language learning have become increasingly popular, mainly due to advances in developing machine learning techniques, and the availability of vast collections of experimental data on child language learning and child-adult interaction; the input-ouput which allows for supervised learning. Many of the existing computational models attempt to study the complex task of learning a language under cognitive plausibility criteria (such as memory and processing limitations that humans face), and to explain the developmental stages observed in children. By simulating the process of human language learning, computational models can show us which linguistic representations are learnable from the input that humans have access to, and which mechanisms yield the same patterns of behaviour that humans exhibit during this process. In doing so, computational modeling provides insight into the plausible mechanisms involved in human language acquisition, and inspires the development of better language models and techniques; specifically in data collection.

The chapters from the book we're going to read will provide us with an overview and the current state of art within the field of human language acquisition. It reviews the most commonly used computational frameworks, methodologies and resources for modeling human language learning, and the evaluation techniques used for assessing these computational models. While the book is aimed at scientists who want to become familiar with the available computational methods to investigate human language acquisition, it will provide us with fundantional knowledge and handles for data- and AI- scientist can use to improve and interpret their model results.

## Goal of using this book
So, your goal in using this book will be to use it to improve and interpret your model results for both written text/conversation as spoken text/conversations while being able to link it to other sensory cues; e.g. pain after cursing or a smiling loved one.

## Learning Objectives:
To start of with, we're going to focus on child language acquisition because it's the least complex and our time is limited. Therefore, we're going to explore the first 3 chapters of [Computational modeling of human language acquisition](https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/ADS-AI/blob/d42ffd034a2d1a35752d7c83c30300288a4ae153/docs/Study%20Content/Cognition%20Fundamentals/assets/sources/Computational%20Modeling%20of%20Human%20Language%20Acquisition.pdf) so you as a student will be able to: 
1. Understand and explain the fundamentals of human language acquisition. 
2. Understand and explain how computational models such as supervised machine learning are use to investigate human language acquision. 
3. Understand and explain how humans learn the meaning of words.



## Datalab Preparation 
1. Read the preface and chapter 1, 2 and 3; you can skip the abstract and other preceeding parts.
2. Take a look at your Vision_Auditory_Cognition_Flowchart file you created yesterday. Would a human with the cognitive system described in your flowchart be able: 
- A) to map the perceived sounds to words? If not, iterate on your flowchart to make it work.
- B) to map those words to their respective meanings? If not, iterate on your flowchart to make it work.
3. Optional Primer: Take a look at use-case one. 
- A) Can you already see how the scenario would play out if you run it through your flowchart?
- B) Answer for each of the following model(s) whether they would be suitable to learn the learn the word in use-case 1: 
        I. Feed-Forward Neural Network (single or multilayerd?)
        II. Recurrent Neural Network
        III. Naive Bayes
        IV. Linear Regression
        V. Logistic Regression.
