# 1. Decision-making & Actions- Workshop

## Learning Objectives: 
1. Sample relevant real-world input required for situational awareness & reinforcement learning.
2. Sample cognitive processes used to process relevant real-world input required for situational awareness & reinforcement learning.
3. Using situational awareness & reinforcement learning to respond.

2. Creative Briefing: Iterate on you flowchart: 10:00 - 12:00 
- Lunch -
3. Decision-making & Actions Lecture: 13:00 - 14:30
4. Decision-making & Actions Tutorial: 14:30 - 17:00



## Lecture - Cognition Fundamentals: Perception & Learning Refresher
Live lecture which is given at the 15th of December from 9:15 till 10:00. Take a look at your timetable to see where and when exactly the lecture takes place! If you can't wait, [here are the slides already](https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/ADS-AI/blob/8a312a9350b35bad7ebbf135293d669582d8575d/docs/Study%20Content/Cognition%20Fundamentals/assets/lectures/Cognition%20Fundamentals%20-%20Decision-making%20and%20Actions.pptx) but after the lecture, there should be [a recording available here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&feature=share&si=ELPmzJkDCLju2KnD5oyZMQ)

## Creative Briefing: Iterate on you flowchart
Open your flowchart and technical report or notes thereof, these are going to be the tools to make our design. Answer the following question using your flowchart and supplemented with text:
1. Which cognitive systems are involved in the bin-picking tasks?

# Object Detection Algorithm
Having layed out that groundwork condition, we are going to work the (creative brief)[https://adsai.buas.nl/Year2/BlockB/#cognition]. Using your flowchart supplemented by text in your report/notes we're going to:
2. **Identify appropriate perceptual features for object detection:** what does the human and robot both have to perceive to detect the objects? 
3. **Identify required prior-knowledge for contextualising object detection:** what do the human and robot both need to know about the object to detect the object and know what to do with it?
4. **Use cognitive models of pattern recognition to improve feature and/or object detection:** which visual perception processes (e.g. edge detection) can help recognize the object (characteristics) faster and with greather relieability?

### Robotic Controller & Reinforcement Learning algorithm
5. **Identifiy relevant real-world input required for situational awareness & reinforcement learning:** What does the robot need to know to make out what is going on in the situation and environment? How does the robot receive negative and positive feedback?
6. **Identify cognitive processes used to process relevant real-world input required for situational awareness & reinforcement learning:** How does the robot know what is going on in the situation and environment, and how does he know what to do? How does the robot learn using reinforcement learning?


Note that these apart from designing, implementing it is also part for the (higher assessment criteria)[https://adsai.buas.nl/Year2/BlockB/#cognition].
