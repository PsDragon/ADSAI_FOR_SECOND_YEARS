# 1. Language Learning in Dynamic Environments 
Just what is the difference between sensing and perceiving? And how does vision actually work? What does perception even mean? What's the difference between seeing something and making sense of it? And how do we memorize and learn all of that? Today we're going to answer all of these questions!

Then, we're going to apply these concepts to creating a perceptual model of human cognitive vision; how a human would see our bin-picking task. So we're going to place ourselves in the shoes of the robot, fill in the template and then elaborate on it by doing some research into human cognitive vision! 
Seeing and perceiving however is not enough, humans will also need to remember, relate and contextualize what it sees in order to decide what to do. So after defining our model of human cognitive vision, we're going to learn about the human memory and where how reinforcement learning works!

Finally, we're going to translate our cognitive model of human vision and memory into a model for our robot which does object detection and reinforcement learning . As the project progresses you can then use your flowchart model of the robot to design & maintain an oversight of your code implementation and subsequently communicate it in your technical report!

## Learning Objectives: 
1. Identify appropriate perceptual features for object detection.
2. Identify required prior-knowledge for contextualising object detection.
3. Use cognitive models of pattern recognition to improve feature and/or object detection.
4.	Identifiy relevant real-world input required for situational awareness & reinforcement learning.
5.	Identify cognitive processes used to process relevant real-world input required for situational awareness & reinforcement learning.

## Lecture - Cognition Fundamentals: Perception
Live lecture which is given on the 17th of November from 9:00 till 10:00 with a 20 min break. Take a look at your timetable to see where and when exactly the lecture takes place! If you can't wait, [here are the slides already](https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/ADS-AI/blob/ba08eaff3a1f5c036abab9a5d1bdd729ad861bc9/docs/Study%20Content/Cognition%20Fundamentals/assets/lectures/Cognition%20Fundamentals%20-%20Perception.pptx) but after the lecture, there should be [a recording available here!](https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/heijligers_b_buas_nl/EXq2Oz4etehLjvVx1iznypMBXXd4w4bjWHbvEtTopNEiLg?e=uD2gAb)

Relevant literature to research:
- [Summary of Concepts and Terms](https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/ADS-AI/blob/260f3f788372cfb55e2a4ba2956800de1b3b14a8/docs/Study%20Content/Cognition%20Fundamentals/assets/Summary%20of%20Concepts%20and%20Terms.docx): Highly recommended read which summarizes most important concepts discussed in the literature below. It also contains various important model you can use to create cognitive systems; or systems to deal with information processing in general.
