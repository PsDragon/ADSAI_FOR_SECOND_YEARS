# Language Learning in Dynamic Environments 
AN INTRODUCTION TO THE TOPIC:
- GENERAL
- MORPHOLOGY
- PRAGMATISM
- LEXICAL CATEGORIES
- STRUCTURAL KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGE
- SEMANTIC BOOTSTRAPPING
- CONSTRUCTION GRAMMAR & LEARNING
- SEMANTIC ROLES

## Learning Objectives: 
1. Understand and analyse how humans can put words together to form more complex structures of meaning; and how this can be derived from the environment.
2. Understand and analyse how human can acquire meaning from form; relational sentence structure.
3. Understand and analyse how humans can acquire meaning from a dynamic context; environmental conditions changing over time.



## Datalab Preparation 
1. Read chapter 4 and 5.



## Done? 
Continue working on your flowchart if you haven't finished!
