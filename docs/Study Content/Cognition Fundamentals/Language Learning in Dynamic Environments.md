# Language Learning in Dynamic Environments 
Human language learning in dynamic environments refers to the process by which humans acquire and adapt their language skills in response to changes in their linguistic and social environments. This can be very simple from assigning a word (e.g. cup) from one object; e.g. a cup filled with water to all types of cups and liquids contained therein. But it doesn't stop just there: as we've learned the context; or environment, in which we learning something can vary widely and can take all kinds of forms and shapes.

In more complex dynamic environments, linguistic input can vary widely in terms of dialect, grammar, and vocabulary, and may change rapidly in response to social, cultural, or technological factors ([e.g. learn new cool words](http://wapo.st/2abLsZi)). This presents a challenge for language learners, who must be able to process and adapt to this variability in order to communicate effectively.

One important aspect of learning language in dynamic environments is the ability to recognize and accommodate different dialects and registers of a language, which may vary by geographic region, social class, or cultural group ([e.g. carnaval in limburg](https://youtube.com/watch?v=YBlp9SUg8u8&feature=shares)). This requires learners to develop sensitivity to the nuances of language use and to adjust their own speech accordingly.

Another important aspect of language learning in dynamic environments is the ability to acquire and use new vocabulary and grammar structures as they arise ([e.g. Biden keeps saying 'malarkey'](http://wapo.st/2abLsZi)). This may involve exposure to new words or phrases through social interactions or media, as well as active engagement in reading and writing activities ([e.g. You Only YOLO Once](https://youtube.com/watch?v=z5Otla5157c&feature=shares)).

As you see, language learning can become rather complex and expectations of how human communicate with one another change over time and in a given context (e.g. you'll have higher expectations from your lecturer then the cashier). When you dive deeper into this topic, this all becomes rather complex. However, for our purposes, we'll stick to children language acquisition for our use-cases since it's much more understandable and manageable for our time-frame.


## Learning Objectives: 
1. Understand and analyse how humans can put words together to form more complex structures of meaning; and how this can be derived from the environment.
2. Understand and analyse how human can acquire meaning from form; relational sentence structure.
3. Understand and analyse how humans can acquire meaning from a dynamic context; environmental conditions changing over time.
