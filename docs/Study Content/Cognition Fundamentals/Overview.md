## What is cognition?

Note that learning is actually a big part of cognition; after all what good is processing information if you don't learn; store information to interact more efficiently with your environment (intelligence = efficient environmental interaction), from it? But psychology views things a bit differently sometimes: it's a young evolving field like AI and Data Science!

## And where did it come from and how does it relate to AI?

Note that [the cognitive revolution was a wider phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_revolution) and not a Harvard invention but he is a proffessor at Harvard so who can blame him for doing some marketing? Great explainer though and ties well to our (symbolic) AI approach!



## Year 2B - Cognitive Robotics:
Cognitive robots achieve their goals by perceiving their environment, paying attention to the events that matter, planning what to do, anticipating the outcome of their actions and the actions of other agents, and learning from the resultant interaction. They deal with the inherent uncertainty of natural environments by continually learning, reasoning, sharing their knowledge and making decision based on that knowledge.
