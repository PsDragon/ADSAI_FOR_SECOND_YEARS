# 1. Overview & Sources

## Why learn about cognitive science?
Cognition is the act of knowing, specifially: how we process the information around us to know what we do and act upon that; resulting in behaviour. To find out how humans process that information, cognitive scientist make computational models central processes in the human mind (conceptual), brain (physical) and behaviour (interaction). Information comes ofcourse in many different forms and therefore cognitive science integrates many different disciplines such as psychology, computer science, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, ludology (game studies), linguistics, antropology, formal logic, philosophy etc. That's why cognitive science is a crucial link between technology (computation) and human behaviour; and why it relevant in the field of data science and artificial intelligence; especially when dealing with human behaviour! This course aims to teach you the fundamentals of cognitive science and applicable concepts for solving problems in the field of data science and artificial intelligence! 

## What is cognition?

Note that learning is actually a big part of cognition; after all what good is processing information if you don't learn; store information to interact more efficiently with your environment (intelligence = efficient environmental interaction given some goal ~), from it? But psychology views things a bit differently sometimes: it's a young evolving field like AI and Data Science!

## Where did it come from?

Note that [the cognitive revolution was a wider phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_revolution) and not a Harvard invention but he is a proffessor at Harvard so who can blame him for doing some marketing? Great explainer though and ties well to our (symbolic) AI approach!

## Learning Objectives
1. Describe (neuro-)psychological methods of measuring attention, perception and memory;
2. Apply cognitive theories of attention, perception and memory to the domain of human-technology interaction.
3. Describe and apply computational methods of measuring attention, perception and memory;

## Year 2B - Cognitive Robotics:
Cognitive robots achieve their goals by perceiving their environment, paying attention to the events that matter, planning what to do, anticipating the outcome of their actions and the actions of other agents, and learning from the resultant interaction. They deal with the inherent uncertainty of natural environments by continually learning, reasoning, sharing their knowledge and making decision based on that knowledge.
