# 1. Perception & Learning - Study Material
Some text about Perception.

## Learning Objectives: 
1. Identify appropriate perceptual features for object detection.
2. Identify required prior-knowledge for contextualising object detection.
3. Use cognitive models of pattern recognition to improve feature and/or object detection.
4.	Identifiy relevant real-world input required for situational awareness & reinforcement learning.
5.	Identify cognitive processes used to process relevant real-world input required for situational awareness & reinforcement learning.
