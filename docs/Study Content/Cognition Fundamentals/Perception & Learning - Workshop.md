# 1. Perception & Learning - Workshop
Just what is the difference between sensing and perceiving? And how does vision actually work? So what does perception even mean? What's the difference between seeing something and making sense of it? Today we're going to answer all of these questions!

Then, we're going to apply these concepts to creating a senso-perceptual model of what our robot would need to see! Seeing and perceiving however is not enough, our robot will also need to remember, relate and contextualize what it sees in order to decide what to do. So after defining our senso-perceptual model, we're going to learn about the human memory and where how reinforcement learning works!


## Learning Objectives: 
1. Identify appropriate perceptual features for object detection.
2. Identify required prior-knowledge for contextualising object detection.
3. Use cognitive models of pattern recognition to improve feature and/or object detection.
4.	Identifiy relevant real-world input required for situational awareness & reinforcement learning.
5.	Identify cognitive processes used to process relevant real-world input required for situational awareness & reinforcement learning.

## Kick-off & Lecture - Cognition Fundamentals: Perception
Live lecture which is given on the 17th of November from 9:00 till 10:00 with a 20 min break. Take a look at your timetable to see where and when exactly the lecture takes place! If you can't wait, [here are the slides already](https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/ADS-AI/blob/8a312a9350b35bad7ebbf135293d669582d8575d/docs/Study%20Content/Cognition%20Fundamentals/assets/lectures/Cognition%20Fundamentals%20-%20Perception.pptx) but after the lecture, there should be [a recording available here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&feature=share&si=ELPmzJkDCLju2KnD5oyZMQ)

## Refreshers

## Tutorial - Cognition Fundamentals: Perception
Imagine that you're doing the bin-picking task and that you are trying to perceive what information defines the object and target area that you are trying to perceive.

It also contains various important model you can use to create cognitive systems; or systems to deal with information processing in general.
