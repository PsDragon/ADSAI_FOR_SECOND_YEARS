# 1. Perception & Learning - Workshop
Some text about Perception.

## Learning Objectives: 
1. Identify appropriate perceptual features for object detection.
2. Identify required prior-knowledge for contextualising object detection.
3. Use cognitive models of pattern recognition to improve feature and/or object detection.
4.	Identifiy relevant real-world input required for situational awareness & reinforcement learning.
5.	Identify cognitive processes used to process relevant real-world input required for situational awareness & reinforcement learning.

## Kick-off & Lecture - Cognition Fundamentals: Perception
Live lecture which is given on the 17th of November from 9:00 till 9:30-DATE. Take a look at your timetable to see where and when exactly the lecture takes place! If you can't wait, [here are the slides already](https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/ADS-AI/blob/8a312a9350b35bad7ebbf135293d669582d8575d/docs/Study%20Content/Cognition%20Fundamentals/assets/lectures/Cognition%20Fundamentals%20-%20Perception.pptx) but after the lecture, there should be [a recording available here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&feature=share&si=ELPmzJkDCLju2KnD5oyZMQ)



## Tutorial - Cognition Fundamentals: Perception
Imagine that you're doing the bin-picking task.

You can use the (Summary of Concepts and Terms)[https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/ADS-AI/blob/260f3f788372cfb55e2a4ba2956800de1b3b14a8/docs/Study%20Content/Cognition%20Fundamentals/assets/Summary%20of%20Concepts%20and%20Terms.docx] as a guide to identify perceptual features for object recognition. Highly recommended read which summarizes most important concepts discussed in the literature attached in the overview. It also contains various important models you can use to create cognitive systems; or systems to deal with information processing in general.
