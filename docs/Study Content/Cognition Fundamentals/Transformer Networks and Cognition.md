# Transformer Networks and Cognition
AN INTRODUCTION TO THE TOPIC

## Learning Objectives: 
1. Understand and evaluate the simmilarities and distictions between transformer networks used in state-of-the-art large language models and human cognitive system in the context of language aquisition & auditory perception. 



## Lecture - Transformer Networks and Cognition
Live lecture which is given on the 3rd of March from 9:00 till 10:00 with a 20 min break. You can find the slides [here](LINK) and after the lecture, there should be [a recording available here!](LINK)
