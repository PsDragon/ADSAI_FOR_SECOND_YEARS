# Perception & Learning - Datalab
Today we're going to continue with putting ourselves in the shoes of our robot and create a flowchart of a cognitive model for perceptual processing of sensory information and how we story and manage that information; how we learn from it. 

After making that first draft we're going to make a start in creating a flowcharts of our robots functionality following the same input-proccessing-output model. You'll continue to work and build on this model during the next weeks as you further develop your object detection algorithm, robotic controller and reinforcement learning algorithm. 

Take a look at [yesterday's workshop material](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Cognition%20Fundamentals/Perception%20&%20Learning%20-%20Workshop.html) to further work out your flowchart!

## Learning Objectives: 
1. Identify appropriate perceptual features for object detection.
2. Identify required prior-knowledge for contextualising object detection.
3. Use cognitive models of pattern recognition to improve feature and/or object detection.
4.	Identifiy relevant real-world input required for situational awareness & reinforcement learning.
5.	Identify cognitive processes used to process relevant real-world input required for situational awareness & reinforcement learning.
