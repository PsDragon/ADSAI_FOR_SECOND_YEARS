# Advanced Power BI
Today, we primarily work on our dashboard to **finish and hand it in before 17:00 today!** However, there is much more to learn in Power BI! Becoming an advanced Power BI user is optional ofcourse but will gain you skills and a certificate which can help you with your future career!

If you still need to work on your dashboard, do this instead. Remember that **the deadline for handing in the Dashboard is Today (Thursday of week 7) at 17:00!** If you feel like you don't need to recap or need some time off, today is a good day for that. You should take some time to recharge if you feel like it :)

Please follow the links below to continue the class:
0. Carreer track: 
1. Proposed workshop: 3 hours
2. Working on Dashboard: - 

## Questions or issues?

If you have questions or issues regarding the course material, please fill out the 'How Can We Help?' form under the section ['Ask me anything'](https://adsai.buas.nl/Contact%20Us/). A member of our teaching staff will respond as soon as possible.

## 0) Carreer track
Datacamp, and virtually every other online learning platform, creates learning paths you can follow in order to gain a specific skillset. Usually these paths come with a certificate and by doing all the courses on datacamp you have already the Power BI Fundamental certificate (or: Statement of Accomlishment)! You can get an advanced one as well if you enjoy Power BI and want to become a data analyst. Here you can see [the carreer path if you want to become an advanced Power BI user!](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-analyst-in-power-bi).

## 1) Proposed Workshop: Intermediate Data Modeling in Power BI
The bachelor program also hands out medal for those who are willing to go the extra mile. For this block, the gold medal condition is doing a valid correlational or regression analysis in Power BI. If you are up for it, do the workshop: [Intermediate Data Modeling in Power BI](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-data-modeling-in-power-bi) and apply a data modelling method to your dashboard!

## 2) Optional: Getting more advanced
You can look at these if you want to explain more aspects of the data! (and if you crave a sneak peak in Year 2).

### Distributions: The Shape of Data
When collecting data to make observations about the world, it usually just isn't possible to collect ALL THE DATA. So instead of asking every single person about student loan debt for instance, we take a sample of the population and then use the shape of our samples to make inferences about the true underlying distribution of our data. It turns out we can learn a lot about how something occurs, even if we don't know the underlying process that causes it. So today, we'll also introduce the normal (or bell) curve and talk about how we can learn some really useful things from a sample's shape - like if an exam was particularly difficult, how often old faithful erupt, or if two types of runners participate in marathons!

Today is the day we finally talk about the normal distribution! The normal distribution is incredibly important in statistics because distributions of means are normally distributed even if populations aren't. We'll get into why this is so - due to the Central Limit Theorem - but it's useful because it allows us to make comparisons between different groups even if we don't know the underlying distribution of the population being studied.

### Probabilities and Randomness
Now, we're going to begin our journey into probabilities. We'll talk about how the addition (OR) rule, the multiplication (AND) rule, and conditional probabilities help us figure out the likelihood of sequences of events happening - from optimising your chances of having a great night out with friends to spotting a famous person!

This film will introduce you to bayesian statistics and demonstrate how this new approach to statistics has revolutionized the field from artificial intelligence and clinical trials to how your computer filters spam! We'll also discuss the Law of Large Numbers and how we can use simulations to help us better understand the "rules" of our data, even if we don't know the equations that define those rules.  But, don't worry, learning Bayesesian statistics is not part of this course.

There are many events in life that we just can’t predict, but just because something is random doesn’t mean we don’t know or can’t learn anything about it. This instructor will talk about how we can extract information from seemingly random events starting with the expected value or mean of a distribution and walking through the first four ‘moments’   - the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.

[Crash course](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q) makes some amazing educational videos on all kinds of topics, I highly recommend them for recreational use as well.


## 3) Work on Dashboard
Doesn't really need explaining right? Make any changes you still need to, especially those from feedback gathered from your mentors (or other lecturing staff) yesterday! Remember to save your changes to github and your learning log! Also fill in your worklog! If your worklog and learninglog are lacking, work on them now; they're vital pieces of evidence without which you can't be graded! Remember that **the deadline for handing in the Dashboard is Thursday of week 7 at 17:00!**



## The end!
Tomorrow we will have the dashboard demonstration, here you'll get to stand next to your dashboard and present it to class!
