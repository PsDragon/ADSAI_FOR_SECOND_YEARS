# Advanced Power BI
Today, we primarily work on our dashboard to **finish and hand it in before 17:00 today!** However, there is much more to learn in Power BI! Becoming an advanced Power BI user is optional ofcourse but will gain you skills and a certificate which can help you with your future career!

If you still need to work on your dashboard, do this instead. Remember that **the deadline for handing in the Dashboard is Today (Thursday of week 7) at 17:00!** If you feel like you don't need to recap or need some time off, today is a good day for that. You should take some time to recharge if you feel like it :)

Please follow the links below to continue the class:
0. Carreer track: 
1. Proposed workshop: 3 hours
2. Working on Dashboard: -

## 0) Carreer track
Datacamp, and virtually every other online learning platform, creates learning paths you can follow in order to gain a specific skillset. Usually these paths come with a certificate and by doing all the courses on datacamp you have already the Power BI Fundamental certificate (or: Statement of Accomlishment)! You can get an advanced one as well if you enjoy Power BI and want to become a data analyst. Here you can see [the carreer path if you want to become an advanced Power BI user!](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-analyst-in-power-bi).

## 1) Proposed Workshop: Intermediate Data Modeling in Power BI
The bachelor program also hands out medal for those who are willing to go the extra mile. For this block, the gold medal condition is doing a valid correlational or regression analysis in Power BI. If you are up for it, do the workshop: [Intermediate Data Modeling in Power BI](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-data-modeling-in-power-bi) and apply a data modelling method to your dashboard!

## 2) Work on Dashboard
Doesn't really need explaining right? Make any changes you still need to, especially those from feedback gathered from your mentors (or other lecturing staff) yesterday! Remember to save your changes to github and your learning log! Also fill in your worklog! If your worklog and learninglog are lacking, work on them now; they're vital pieces of evidence without which you can't be graded! Remember that **the deadline for handing in the Dashboard is Thursday of week 7 at 17:00!**

## The end!
Tomorrow we will have the dashboard demonstration, here you'll get to stand next to your dashboard and present it to class!
