# Analysing Relationships between Variables

We start by a brief refresher to sigma notations and by revisiting correlation and applying it. Then, we're going to take a deep dive into measures of association by doing the Codecademy course into hypothesis testing in R. There's no mock assessment since we'll need our time for the course. Still, we'll apply our new knowledge tomorrow in class!

Learning objectives:
- Correlational Analyses;
- T-Tests Analyses;
- ANOVA Analyses;
- Significance level;
- Assumptions of Numerical Hypothesis Tests.


Please follow the links below to continue the class:
1. Correlations & Sigma Notations: .5 hour
2. Workshop: 6 hours
3. Mock-Assessment: 1 hour


Good luck!

## 0) Sigma notations
A brief introduction, or refresher, to Sigma notations. Something which will be used frequently.

## 1) Hypothesis Testing in R
In this short course, we're briefly going to recap on distributions, specifically the difference between the real; or actual population distribution and that of a sample. To complete our project, we need to know which type of analysis we need to address our research question. To answer your research question, you first need to form a hypothesis. Therefore, we're going to dive into hypothesis testing to start to analyze the relationships we're interested in!

Now, we will let Codecademy do the rest of the explaining: do the [Hypothesis testing with R course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-statistics-with-r/modules/hypothesis-testing-r).

# 4)  In-Class discussion
At 16:00, there's an online meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Tomorrow we're going to cover writing a discussion section for our conference poster!

## Questions or issues?
In case you have any questions, please first ask your peers or (when they don't respond timely) [ask us or notify us of any issues you're having](https://github.com/BredaUniversity/AAI-DM/issues/new) and make sure to include the name of the course, workshop and question you have or the problem you're experiencing.
