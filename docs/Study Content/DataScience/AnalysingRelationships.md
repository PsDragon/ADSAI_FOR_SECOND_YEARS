Good luck!

## 0) Sigma notations
A brief introduction, or refresher, to Sigma notations. Something which will be used frequently.

## 1) Correlations
Today we’re going to talk about data relationships and what we can learn from them. We’ll first focus on correlation, which is a measure of how two variables move together, and we’ll also introduce some useful statistical terms you’ve probably heard of like regression coefficient, correlation coefficient (r), and r^2. But first, we’ll need to introduce a useful way to represent bivariate continuous data - the scatter plot. The scatter plot has been called “the most useful invention in the history of statistical graphics” but that doesn’t necessarily mean it can tell us everything. Just because two data sets move together doesn’t necessarily mean one CAUSES the other. This gives us one of the most important tenets of statistics: correlation does not imply causation.

It's not the purpose of the assessment to  a correlational analysis in R, you should suggest one you should do on the data. But, if you want to go more in depth into correlation and play around in it in R, then I suggest doing [these excercises](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/04/correlation-and-correlogram-exercises/).


## 3) Mock assessment
 Create an R Script called AnalysingRelationshipsBetweenVariables_[YourNameHere] and save it to the GitHUb Classroom folder of the same name in your repository.

 1. Use [this artcile](https://www.statology.org/correlation-coefficient-by-hand/) article to calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient between Age X and Glucose Level Y by hand, or in R using [operators only](https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/operator/).


## 2) Hypothesis Testing in R
In this short course we're briefly going to recap on distributions, specifically the difference between the real; or actual population, distribution and that of a sample. To successfully complete our project we need to know which type of analysis we need to adress our research question. To answer your research question, you first need to form a hypothesis. Therefore, we're going to dive into hypothesis testing so we can start to analyze the relationships we're interested in!

Now, we're going to let Codecademy do the rest of the explaining: do the [Hypothesis testing with R course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-statistics-with-r/modules/hypothesis-testing-r).

# 4)  In-Class discussion
At 16:00, there's a online meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Tomorrow we're going to cover writing a discussing section for our conference poster!

## Questions
In case you have any questions please first ask your peers or (when they don't respond timely) [ask us or notify us of any issues you're having](https://github.com/BredaUniversity/AAI-DM/issues/new) and make sure to include the name of the course, workshop and question you have or the problem you're experiencing.
