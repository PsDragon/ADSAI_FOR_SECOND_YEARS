# Block A Recap
Today, we recap everything we learned in Block A about data science in R, primarily descriptive statistics. To achieve this, we're going to do this using a mini-course on Codecademy.

If you still need to work on your poster, feel free to do this instead. Remember that **the deadline for handing in the conference poster is Friday of week 8 at 17:00!** If you feel like you don't need to recap or need some time off, today is a good day for that. You should take some time to recharge if you feel like it :)

Please follow the links below to continue the class:
1. Workshop: 6 hours

## Questions or issues?

If you have questions or issues regarding the course material, please fill out the 'How Can We Help?' form under the section ['Ask me anything'](https://adsai.buas.nl/Contact%20Us/). A member of our teaching staff will respond as soon as possible.

## 0) Workshop
[Go to codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-statistics-with-r) and log in with your BUAS credential. The course will reinforce the core data science learning objectives for this block.
**The course on hypothesis testing is not part of our year 1 curriculum** so I wouldn't do that one just yet. We'll go into that in year 2.



## The end!
Tomorrow we will have some time to work on the conference poster and then at 13:00 you'll have the poster demonstration. This is a formative assessment on your conference poster meaning that you are given a chance to collect feedback and reflect: you are not assessed for a grade, that takes place in week 9.
