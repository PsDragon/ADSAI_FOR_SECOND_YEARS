## 0) Datalab Preparation: Case-study Workshop
Now it's time for the [the workshop part](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/case-study-analyzing-job-market-data-in-power-bi) of this class to practise our recently acquired skills in Power BI by doing a case study. We do this by solving a use case for which we have to do understand, clean, transform and visualise the data in a dashboard. Complete the entire course and upload the certificate to github, reference the certificate in your learning log for this week.

If you get stuck, first ask your peers and then us!

## 1) Up Next

Tomorrow, we will create some cool data visualisations for the findings section of our dashboard!
