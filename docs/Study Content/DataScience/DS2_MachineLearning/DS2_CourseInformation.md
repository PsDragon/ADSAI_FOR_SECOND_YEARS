# Course Overview
This module introduces students to the fundamental concepts and techniques in Machine Learning. These concepts are of three kinds. First, it will introduce students to the different types of machine learning algorithms; supervised vs. unsupervised and how they can be applied. Second, the module introduces students to different types of output: regression versus classification. Lastly, the module will focus on applying and evaluating machine learning models using the Python programming language. 
## 0) Learning Objectives
A) The student will gain an understanding of fundamental machine learning techniques for data analysis, specifically covering the following topics:
1.	Linear regression
2.	Logistic regression
3.	Decision trees
4.	K-means Clustering
5.	K-Nearest-Neighbour 
6.	Neural Networks: Perceptron

B) The student learns to design and implement machine learning algorithms, specifically covering the following topics:
1.	Thinking about machine learning problems: Why, what for and where to use machine learning?
2.	Different types of output: Regression vs. classification 
3.	Different types of machine learning: Supervised vs. Unsupervised
4.	Model evaluation: A) Train set vs. Validation set vs. Test set, B) Accuracy, Recall, Precision, C) Bias-variance trade-off



## 1) General lesson structure
Each self-study day is dedicated to a specific lesson which generally consists of the following components:
1. Overview
2. Lecture
3. Workshop
4. Mock-assessment

How each specific lesson is structured depends on the nature of the content and learning goals. Usually however, these components can be found as seperate Github pages, but these components can also be combined into 1, 2 or 3 pages. 

## 2) Schedule
TODO

## 3) More info?

Look at the creative brief or ask us a [Question](https://github.com/BredaUniversity/AAI-DM/issues/new) (make sure to include the course, class and relevant keywords in the title) about the course content.

## 4) Assessment

Design a predictive or prescriptive model for a given use-case using a machine learning algorithm. Apply, iterate upon and evaluate the model. Subsequently present your work by: 
-	2-weekly evaluation - formative assessment: to evaluate students’ progress and models created in the datalab projects.
-	Final evaluation - summative assessment: Present your final model in an appropriate text, tabular and/or graphical visualisation by integrating this into the dashboard* with the appropriate contextual information. Note that if dashboard integration fails you provide a ZIP file which contains a document which can refer to the files containing your model output on github instead.
 
The use of Python is encouraged, but students are free to use R to complete (parts of) the material for final assessment.

More information on the assessment can be found in the LINK TO FILE

## 5) Course resources:
You don't have to get or buy any books yourself (#SaveTheTrees) but if you are eager to go beyond the scope of the course you can dive into the course resources yourself:

-	Python and data analytics libraries (pandas, numpy, mathplotlib, scipy, scikit-learn, etc.)
-	R and data analytics libraries (cran, ggplot2, dplyr, reshap2, etc.)
-	https://www.codecademy.com/courses/machine-learning
-	An introduction to Statistical Learning: https://www.statlearning.com/ 


#  Today's class
We start of with a comfortable revisit of linear regression after which we will deepen our knowledge base and understanding of these algorithms.
