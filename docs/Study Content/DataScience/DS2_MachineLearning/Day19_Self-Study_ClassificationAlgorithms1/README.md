# Readme DS Self-Study Day Template - Data Science Documentation

## Folder Overview & Structure
A self-study day for data science consists out of 4 parts:
1. Written overview of the day's topics and objectives.
	- Links to the different parts of that specific datalab day and gives a justification for the work we're asking students to do for a specific day.
2. Lecture 
	- Can be a introduction to or overview of the day's topics, a self-made lecture, online material or an actual guest lecture
	- This files links to slides, video, online lecture links accompanied by a description.
3. Mock-Assessment
	- Every workshop includes a small mock-assessment to prepare you for the actual component you'll create for the eventual creative brief in datalab.
	- The mock-assessment should therefore reflect what the student is going to apply from this self-study day (and prefereably only this) into his datalab project.
	- The mock-assessment does not take the student by the hand but provides the student with all essential materials, data and instructions to perform the task
	- The mock-assessment focusses on the application of knowlegde, analyzing and evaluating of problems using their newly gained knowledge. It explicitly does not does not focus on the act of creating novel or original solutions as this is part of data-lab.
	- The mock-assessment material can be embedded in the workshop if this is more sensible and communicate to the student
4. Workshop
	- Provides the student with materials the day's educational content in a form best suited given the type of content. 
	- The workshop involves the student practicing with his new knowledge by doing some excercises. This can therefore be a worksheet, an interactive excercise (live or offline, in groups or individual) or a small single problem statement to apply, analyze or evaluate.
	
## Background
Self-study day: During the lecture and workshop the student will primarily focus on the bottom layers of Bloom's taxonomy which the mock-assessment focusses specifically on the application of, analyzing using, and evaluation using the newly gained knowldge. '
Data-lab day: To fully conclude the learning experience the students will apply their knowledge to create novel or original solutions during the data-lab. Always in the form of material which can be used directly or indirectly for the creative brief.

## Usage 
- Don't add any study content or material in the ReadMe.md file
- Use the markdown files to guide students or host to the content you want to show. Don't replace for example the Presentation_DayX.md file with a powerpoint or video presentation'
