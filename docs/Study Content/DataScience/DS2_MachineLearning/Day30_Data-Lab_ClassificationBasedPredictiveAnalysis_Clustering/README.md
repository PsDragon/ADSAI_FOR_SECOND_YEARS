# Readme DS Template Data-lab days - Data Science Documentation

## Folder Overview & Structure
A datalab day for data science consists out of 3 parts:
1. Written overview of the day's topics and objectives.
	- Links to the different parts of that specific datalab day and gives a justification for the work we're asking students to do for a specific day.
2. Presentation 
	- Can be a introduction to or overview of the day, or an actual guest lecture
	- This files links to slides, video, online lecture link or just a description without any content to access as it'll be given in Data-Lab.
3. Creative brief component: to be made/started on that day.
	- The data-lab days are used to work on the creative brief. Such a day can simply be filled with allowing students to freely work on their project or by giving the students the goal to finish a couple of components or building blocks for the eventual process.
	- If the student learned new material (What is a mean?) or methods (Perform linear regression) for Data Science the previous day, then the student will apply the newly learned material to his creative brief. Hereby we complete a complete loop of their learning process as defined by Bloom's Taxonomy: https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-wp0/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2019/03/27124326/Blooms-Taxonomy-650x366.jpg. To further clarify, we accomplish this by reinforcing their knowledge retention using A) Repetition, B) Reflection and by deepening their understanding as they are required to apply their knowledge and skills to create solutions to problems which are more freely defined.

## Usage 
- Don't add any study content or material in the ReadMe.md file
- Use the markdown files to guide students or host to the content you want to show. Don't replace for example the Presentation_DayX.md file with a powerpoint or video presentation'
