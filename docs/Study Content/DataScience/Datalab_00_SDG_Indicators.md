# Datalab 00: SDG indicators

We start with a short introduction to formulating a problem statement based on the given domain(s) of your SDG indicator(s). Subsequently, we will focus on putting our new knowledge into practice by forming a research question. Then, we will use both to create an introduction component for your data-lab project: the Power BI Dashboard.

## Learning Objectives
Enable you to:
1. research your domain;
2. write a problem statement;
3. write a research question;
4. write an introduction.

Today we'll learn how to create the following components of any data science project. If you exceed the estimated duration for a given component and feel like you are squeezed for time, feel free to ask us for help!

Table of contents:
0. Mock-Assessment Review: 0.5 Hours
1. Introduction: 2 hours
2. Guest Lecture SDG Indicators and buas: 11:00 - 12:00
--- Lunch from 12:00 - 13:00 ---
3. Write first draft introduction: 1.5 hours
4. Discuss introductions with mentor group: 1.5 hours
5. Daily Reflection: From 16:30 to 17:00

### Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask a member of staff if you can't figure it out together!

### Stand-up
Get together with a group of 5 and take turns answering the following questions:
- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Are there any impediments in your way?

Good luck!

## 0) Mock-Assessment review: Quantifying our World into Data
Now, let's all find a partner (as in a classmate, not a date) and get our mock-assessments out (assuming you made them) and discuss them. Specifically, analyse and evaluate one another work by listening to one another critically and giving feedback as your partner goes along explaining:
1. What you identified and deconstructed as an object and phenomena and try to justify the decisions you made.
2. What problem statement and research question you created and why you choose this topic. Try to test one another's ideas actively using constructive questions.
3. (optional:) Iterate on your problem statement and research question. When done, commit your changes to your Github respository.

## 1) Writing an introduction
**Step 0.** Have a rough draft of your problem statement and research question. If you're unsure or have any questions, ask your mentor for guidance.
**Step 1.** Watch the following video and note down which elements may be found in the introduction. You already define two fundamental elements: 1) **the problem** you're going to address and 2) you have your research question: **your purpose** is to find an answer to it.

**Step 2.** Decide what information the reader needs to know and write the introduction in your [Power BI Dashboard](docs\assets\Assessment\DS1-AssesmentPoster_Template.pptx).

**Step 3.** Save your dashboard and notes to your Github repository.

**Step 4.** Done early? Help your peers finish 


## 2) In-Class discussion
At 14:30, you will get together with your mentor group to present your:
1. Problem statement
2. Research Question
3. Introduction

After which we will discuss our progress and reflect on today's activities.

Tomorrow, we're going to finish our introduction and cover variables and data frames in PowerBI.
