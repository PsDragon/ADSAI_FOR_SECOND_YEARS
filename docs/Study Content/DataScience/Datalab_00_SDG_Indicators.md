# Datalab 00: SDG indicators

We start with a short introduction to formulating a problem statement based on the given domain(s) of your SDG indicator(s). Subsequently, we will focus on putting our new knowledge into practice by forming a research question. Then, we will use both to create an introduction component for your data-lab project: the Power BI Dashboard.

## Learning Objectives
Enable you to:
1. research your domain;
2. write a problem statement;
3. write a research question;
4. write an introduction.

Today we'll learn how to create the following components of any data science project. If you exceed the estimated duration for a given component and feel like you are squeezed for time, feel free to ask us for help!

Table of contents:
0. Datalab Preparation Review: 0.5 Hours
1. Introduction: 2 hours
2. Write first draft introduction: 2.5 hours
3. Discuss introductions with mentor group: 1.5 hours
4. Daily Reflection: From 16:30 to 17:00

### Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask a member of staff if you can't figure it out together!

### Stand-up
Get together with your mentor group, a student will lead the session, and take turns answering the following questions:
- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Are there any impediments in your way?

Good luck!

## 0) Datalab Preparation review; Quantifying our World into Data, and; Problems Statements & Research Questions
Now, let's all find 5 partners from our mentor group and get our Datalab Preparation files out (assuming you made them) and discuss them. Specifically, analyse and evaluate one another work by listening to one another critically and giving feedback as your partner goes along explaining:
1. What you identified and deconstructed as an object and phenomena and try to justify the decisions you made.
2. What problem statement and research question you created and why you choose this topic. Try to test one another's ideas actively using constructive questions.
3. (optional:) Iterate on your problem statement and research question. When done, commit your changes to your Github respository.

## 1) Writing an introduction
**Step 0.** Have a rough draft of your problem statement and research question. If you're unsure or have any questions, ask your mentor for guidance. There's a [example dashboard](https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/ADS-AI/blob/5bf562ad056760e036d9c6d9170de2415dd4b0f6/docs/Study%20Content/DataScience/assets/Templates/DS1_Dashboard_ExampleTitanic.pbix) for you to look at as well!

**Step 1.** Watch the following video and note down which elements may be found in the introduction. You already define two fundamental elements: 1) **the problem** you're going to address and 2) you have your research question: **your purpose** is to find an answer to it.

**Step 2.** Decide what information the reader needs to know and write the introduction in your Power BI Dashboard by using [this template](https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/ADS-AI/blob/5bf562ad056760e036d9c6d9170de2415dd4b0f6/docs/Study%20Content/DataScience/assets/Templates/DS1_Dashboard_StudentTemplate.pbix).

**Step 3.** Save your dashboard and notes to your Github repository. If your files are too large for Github; upload them to your personal [Sharepoint](www.edubuas.sharepoint.com) folder. Only files on github and sharepoint (team, outlook also upload to sharepoint) are considered for grading. 

**Step 4.** Done early? Help your peers finish

Tip: Tip: Get evidence for the 'Excellent' condition of ILO 1.3 by helping your peers! E.g. by proofreading their dashboard. They may return the favour, and you both get a better learning experience! Make sure to evidence your knowledge-sharing/help in your learning- and worklog!

## 2) Mentor Group discussion
At 14:30, you will get together with your mentor group to present your:
1. Problem statement
2. Research Question
3. Introduction


## 3) In-Class discussion
After which we will discuss our progress and reflect on today's activities.

Tomorrow, we're going to finish our introduction and cover variables and data frames in PowerBI.
