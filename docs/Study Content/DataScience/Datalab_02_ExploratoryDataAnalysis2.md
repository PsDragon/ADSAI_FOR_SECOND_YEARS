# Datalab 02: Exploratory Data Analysis 2

This data-lab day will focus on doing our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for our dashboard project. First, we will download data suiting our problem statement and prepare our data; if you haven't done so already. Then, we will work on the project brief, specifically the EDA methodology section, and apply our data transformtion, preparation and cleaning skills to our data where needed. After that we can do first draft of descriptive analyses to generate descriptive statistics and visualisations to populate (= fill) the EDA Methodology tab of our Power BI dashboard!

## Learning Objectives
Enable you to:
1. generate descriptive statistics for a use-case;
2. generate descriptive visualisations for a use-case;
3. write a basic EDA methodology for a use-case.

Table of contents:
0. Datalab Preparation Review: 0.5 Hours
1. Exploratory Data Analysis on SDG Indicators: 5.5 hours
2. A day in the life of a Data Engineer: 14:30 - 16:00
3. Day reflection: 16:30 - 17:00

### Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask a member of staff if you can't figure it out together!

### Stand-up
Get together with your mentor group, a student will lead the session, and take turns answering the following questions:
- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Are there any impediments in your way?

Good luck!

## 0) Datalab Preparation review
Now, let's all form groups of 5 (or less) from our mentor group and get our Datalab Preparation out; meaning our certificates to show to your mentors, and discuss them with your peers. Specifically, discuss the things you were struggeling with in the courses. Make sure to record your notes and any feedback in your learning log!


## 1) Exploratory Data Analysis: SDG Indicators for the project brief
Today we continue workin on our EDA! During the workshop we have learned all EDA techniques regarding data preparation and EDA we could need to address your problem statement. Which means that now we can continue working on the project brief. If you need a refresher, go back to the previous self-study and datalab days to familliarize yourself with the steps; potentially revisit some courses or videos. You can iterate on your intro; included your problem statement and research question, based on the available/found data as well; science is often iterative!

**Step 1.** Get your notes from the last data lab and read the Introduction you wrote for the dashboard, iterate if you think you need to. Then, if you need to collect (more) data, go to the [SDG website](https://sdg-tracker.org/) and make **a selection of the variables** you think are interesting in the context of your problem statement.

**Step 2.** Open your Power BI Dashboard and inspect the EDA Methodology section. If you have any notes or feedback (e.g. in your learning log) iterate where you deem neccesary on the EDA section. Then, save your dashboard to your GitHub repository; be sure to save and upload your file regularly.

**Step 3.** Download the **relevant** [SDG data](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal/) (or use the link above) and create a dataset which **only contains the variables you selected** (apart from identifier data such as the year or geographic area). Then, save the dataset as a CSV file to your repository.

Now open your dashboard and write the 'Data Selection' Section.


**Step 4.** Open PowerBI and generate descriptive statistics for each variable and save all the results in a table. Then export the table as a .jpeg file, save it to your GitHub repository, and put it in your learning log.

Now, open the dashboard and write the Data Cleaning Sections.


**Step 5.** Generate appropriate descriptive visualisations for your variables and save them as .jpeg file to your GitHub repository. Make sure to at least generate of each variable an appropriate and relevant:
0. Table with summary statistics;
1. Scatterplot;
2. Histogram;
3. Boxplot.

Now open the dashboard and write the Data Selection and Data Visualisation Sections. Be aware that you have creative freedom to shape your dashboad! More specificallyare free to change the formatting and lay-out of the poster as long as you are able to demonstrate what part of your dashboard meets which assessment criteria in your learning log (So the evidence slides for ILO 4.1 and 4.2)! Answering the questions in the template is a sure way to get there! 

When you're done, save your dashboard to your GitHub repository! 

**Step. 6.** Read and potentially iterate on your dashboard! Iterating; assesing what could be improved and making those changes, can be done in many ways and there's not a single right way! Maybe you want to narrow down which graphs you use to describe the characteristics of your data. Or maybe you want to use different data visualisations to convey your data understanding. You can also ask some peers for feedback, record it and your findings in you learning log and iterate on your dashboard like that. 
When you're done, save your dashboard to your GitHub repository! If your files are too large for Github; upload them to your personal folder on [Sharepoint](www.edubuas.sharepoint.com) . Only files on github and sharepoint (team, outlook also upload to sharepoint) are eligible for grading by academy policy (so no google drive, dropbox etc.).

Tip: Get evidence for the 'Excellent' condition of ILO 1.3 by helping your peers! E.g. by proofreading their dashboard. They may return the favour, and you both get a better learning experience! Make sure to evidence your knowledge-sharing/help in your learning- and worklog!

## 2) A Day in a life of a Data Engineer (14:30-15:00)

Each Wednesday, you will have the chance to familiarise yourself with the different roles that constitute a professional data team. This week focuses on the data analyst. <mark>From 15:00-16:00 there will be a guest lecture by Jason Harty (Fe1.018)</mark>. Afterwards, there is time to for asking questions. 

### 2.1 Data Engineer

__2.1a__ Find out what a typical work day looks like for a data Engineer (e.g., daily tasks, and related skills, etc.).

__2.1b__ Come up with at least one question for the guest lecturer Max Poirault concerning his work as a data analyst.  


<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #8a6d3b;; background-color: #fcf8e3; border-color: #faebcc;">
Note: The Bronze Challenge for Block A is creating an infographic that provides an overview of the different roles that constitute a professional data team.

## 3)  In-Class discussion
At 16:30, we'll all get together in our mentor group to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Tomorrow, we're going to hone our skills some more by doing a case study. You'll likely find some interesting techniques and lenses to transfer to you own SDG data analysis!
