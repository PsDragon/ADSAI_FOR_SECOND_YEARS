# Datalab 02: Exploratory Data Analysis 2

This data-lab day will focus on preparing our data for doing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). First, we will download data suiting our problem statement. Then, we will work on the project brief, specifically the EDA methodology section, and apply our data transformtion, preparation and cleaning skills to get our data in so we can do descriptive analyses to generate descriptive statistics and visualisations to populate (= fill) the EDA Methodology tab of our Power BI dashboard of our data-lab project.

## Learning Objectives
Enable you to:
1. generate descriptive statistics;
2. generate descriptive visualisations;
3. write a basic EDA methodology.

Table of contents:
0. Mock-Assessment Review: 0.5 Hours
1. Exploratory Data Analysis workshop: 2-3 Hours
2. Exploratory Data Analysis on SDG Indicators dataset: 5.5- 6.5 hours
3. Day reflection: 16:30 - 17:00

### Stand-up
Get together with a group of 5 and take turns answering the following questions:
- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Are there any impediments in your way?

## 1) Exploratory Data Analysis: Data Preparation on SDG Indicators dataset - Project Brief part
During the workshop we have learned all EDA techniques regarding data preparation we could need to address your problem statement. Which means that now we can continue working on the project brief.

**Step 1.** Open your Power BI Dashboard Template and inspect the EDA Methodology section. Then, save the dashboard to your "DataScience1_Dashboard" GitHub repository and be sure to save and upload your file regularly. Now look at the feedback you have received on your dashboard by navigating to your GitHub repository and clicking on the 'Pull requests' header. There should be a feedback thread over there.

**Step 2.** Get your notes from the last data lab and read the Introduction you wrote for the dashboard. Then, go to the [SDG website](https://sdg-tracker.org/) and make **a selection of the variables** you think are interesting in the context of the problem statement.


**Step 3.** Download the **relevant** [SDG data](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/) and create a dataset which **only contains the variables you selected** (apart from identifier data such as the year or geographic area). Then, save the dataset as a CSV file to your "DataScience1_Dashboard" repository.

Now open your dashboard and write the Data Selection Section.


**Step 4.** Open PowerBI and generate descriptive statistics for each variable and save all the results in a table. Then export the table as a .jpeg file and save it to your GitHub repository.

Now, open the dashboard and write the Data Cleaning Sections.


**Step 5.** Generate appropriate descriptive visualisations for your variables and save them as .jpeg file to your GitHub repository. Make sure to at least generate of each variable an appropriate and relevant:
0. Table with summary statistics;
1. Scatterplot;
2. Histogram;
3. Boxplot.

Now open the dashboard and write the Data Selection and Data Visualisation Sections. Save your script on your GitHub repository and name it aptly: e.g. "SDGIndicatorExploratoryDataAnalysis". 

**Step. 6.** Read and potentially iterate on your dashboard, then save your dashboard to your GitHub repository!


## 2)  In-Class discussion
At 16:30, we'll all get together in our mentor group to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Next week we're going to cover some fundamental concepts of probability theory. It's much more fun than it sounds, I promise. :p


## Questions or issues?
In case you have any questions, please first ask your peers or send us a message on teams instead! We're available on working days from 9:00 tot 17:00.
