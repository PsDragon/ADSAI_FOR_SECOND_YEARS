# Datalab 02: Findings & Data Visualisations

This data-lab day will focus on gaining some skills to make very pretty plots with the famous ggplot2 package. Then we're going to use our new skills to create some, hopefully, cool graphs and visualisations for our data-lab project.

Learning objectives:
Build upon the basic understanding of data representations by learning to create data visualisations which are:
- Informative: of the data (distribution)
- Meaninful: relevant to the data-drive research question
- Unbiased: towards your own expectations
- Visually Clear & Appealing
- Have appropriate legends and additional labels and comments where needed

Table of contents:
1. Workshop: 3 hours
2. Project: 5 hours

Good luck!

## 0) Workshop part: Exploratory Data Analyses
Start where you left off yesterday with the Exploratory Data Analysis and finish modules 8 to 10.

If you don't have the swirl course, then you download the R swirl course [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://swirlstats.com/scn/getclean.html) by running the following code in the R-studio console:
```R
swirl::install_course("Exploratory Data Analysis")
```

Finished? Then you can unleash your skills on your project!

## 1) Creating the findings section
Create appropriate graphical representations and tables of your data to fill the poster, which is:
- Informative: of the data (distribution)
- Meaninful: relevant to the data-driven research question
- Unbiased: towards your own expectations
- Visually Clear & Appealing
- Have appropriate legends and additional labels and comments where needed


# 2) In-Class discussion
At 16:00, there's a online meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Tomorrow, we're going to cover statistical inferences!

## Questions
In case you have any questions please first ask your peers or (when they don't respond timely) [ask us or notify us of any issues you're having](https://github.com/BredaUniversity/AAI-DM/issues/new) and make sure to include the name of the course, workshop and question you have or the problem you're experiencing.
