# Datalab 03: Discussion

This data-lab day will focus on describing and understanding the data on a deeper level: interpreting the data distribution and the summary statics in the context of our research question. Then we will propose an analysis to answer that research question.

Learning objectives:
- Understanding and interpreting real-world descriptive Datalab;
- Judge which analysis is best suited to address a research challenge.


Table of contents:
1. Project: 8 hours (but probably much shorter; 8 hours is the allocated time)


Now, it's time to put all the knowledge we gained into practice by writing the discussion section of our Conference Poster!

***Open your conference poster and inspect the Discussion section. Next, open R-studio and open your script.***

Good luck!


## 0) Considerations in interpreting the data
We start with considering the distribution of the data, the summary statistics and data visualisations. What do they tell us about themselves? How do they relate to the research question?
1. Give an unbiased report of the possible considerations (e.g. Missing data, distribution, collection concerns, domain problems etc.) in interpreting the findings of the EDA.
2. Check if the provided considerations need to be supplemented with domain knowledge.


## 1) Recommendations for future analyses & data-driven decisions:
Now that we have interpreted the data distribution and summary statistics, it's time to consider how we could use our data to answer our research question.
1. Which analysis do you propose to run on the data? Form an unbiased judgement on the considerations. You can suggest multiple analyses as well if you can supplement your recommendation.

Tip: If you are done early, look if you can iterate on your poster. If you want to learn some extra fancy data visualisations skills: do module 8, 9 and potentially 10 as well of the Exploratory Data Analysis course in Swirl.

## 2) In-Class discussion
At 16:00, there's a online meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Next week, we will start diving into report and data visualisation practices.


## Questions or issues?
In case you have any questions please first ask your peers or send us a message on teams instead!
