# Datalab 03: Findings & Data Visualisations

This data-lab day will focus on making clear and helpful data visualisations! First, we'll learn some rules on how to plot data and what makes a good graph. Then, we're going to use our new skills to create some good graphs and visualisations for our data-lab project!

Learning objectives:
Build upon the basic understanding of data representations by learning to create data visualisations which are:
- Informative: of the data (distribution).
- Meaningful: relevant to the data-drive research question.
- Unbiased: towards your own expectations.
- Visually Clear & Appealing.
- Have appropriate legends and additional labels and comments where needed.

Table of contents:
0. Peer-review: 1 hour
1. Workshop: 3 hours
2. Project: 5 hours

Good luck!

### Stand-up
Get together with a group of 5 and take turns answering the following questions:
- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Are there any impediments in your way?

## 0) Peer-review
Open your notes file and be ready to take notes. Take a loot at one another's dashboards and help your peer understand what you did and where you're going with your dashboard. Note down all valuable feedback in your notes file and upload it to your github repository once finished and reference it in your learning log for this week.

## Workshop part: Exploratory Data Analyses


## 1) First things second
Before starting, look at the feedback you have received on your dashboard by navigating to your GitHub repository and clicking on the â€˜Pull requests' header. There should be a feedback thread over there. Process the feedback and then continue as described below.

For those of you who haven't done so already: start uploading your files to our GitHub repository. That way, you never lose (too much) of your work, and we can also help you from a distance if there's something which you can't resolve or don't understand! :)


### 2) Research Questions & Visualizations in Power BI

Before you start visualizing the data you want to come up with a couple of (descriptive) research subquestions which help to answer your central research question (the one in the introduction); try explaining the situation based on these tables and visualisation. For example:

Central question: 
- Are the inhabitants of Breda receiving adequate elderly care?

Subquestions:
- How long does it on average take to receive care?
- Which neighbourhood receives the most care?
- Is there a difference between males and females in terms of receiving care?
- What is the satisfaction rate per care provider?
- How much family aid do the less abled receive?

Research questions are essential because they:

1. Define an investigation/research
2. Set boundaries
3. Provide direction
4. Act as a frame of reference for assessing your work

So try to be creative, and come up with a couple of questions yourself!

It can be difficult to choose a suitable chart to represent (a subset of) your data. From experience, I can tell you that an average data science/business intelligence/artificial intelligence project involves quite some trial and error (one of the reasons that makes our work so much fun, if you ask me :nerd_face:). Nevertheless, a solid theoretical background (e.g. in fields such as statistics, ML, UX design etc.) can give you the edge over a data professional that lacks such a foundation. In practice, it can be the difference between delivering an 'okay' dashboard or a dashboard that conveys a compelling data story to a client.

Tip: Thursday's independent study day material focused on creating visualizations. Want a refresher of the different visuals that are available in Power BI? Read Microsoft's <a href="( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-visualization-types-for-reports-and-q-and-a">Visualization types in Power BI</a> article.

__4a__ Load your dashboard .pbix file in Power BI.

__4b__ Apply the knowledge you have gained by creating the findings section.
Create appropriate graphical representations and tables of your data to fill the dashboard, which are:
- Informative: of the data (distribution).
- Meaningful: relevant to the data-driven research question.
- Unbiased: towards your own expectations.
- Visually clear & appealing.
- Have appropriate legends and additional labels and comments where needed.

Tip: Having troubling choosing the right visualisations for research questions? Maybe this 30 minute lecture about different types of charts can help you chart your course (haha).

# 2) In-Class discussion
At 16:30, we'll all get together in Datalab to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Tomorrow, we're going to continue with probability theory.
