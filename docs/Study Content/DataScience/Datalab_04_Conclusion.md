# Datalab 05: Poster Presentation Day

Today we're doing the poster presentations. You can come in at 13:00 when the poster presentations start.


## 13:00 - 16:00 Poster representations
The lecturers will walk around and inquire you about the posters. The course instructors (Nitin & Bram) will grade you based on the content of your poster.

Some of the other lecturers will be present, these will not know what your project is about. So be prepared to take them through it and answer their questions. In essense this just translates to knowing what you are talking about with respect to the scope of your research project, so don't worry about this too much.

If they ask something you don't know just say: "That's interesting, maybe we could look into that in future analyses."
Sometimes the things they say are simply too big in scope or adressing a different research question: they're asking what they find intesteting. Then you can say something like:

"Good point, however, that is outside of the scope of this study I'm afraid."

or

"Interesting thought, the purpose of this study is not however to [prosal from conversational partner] but to [your research question]".


Expectation management is an important skill for most jobs, and ours all the more due to the complexity of the challenges we're working with: you can't always properly estimate when you will be ready or wheter it will work. So it's important to keep expectations realistic when you are presenting your poster to your stakeholders. Later in the program we will go into these project and team related skills, for now it's just meant to help your present.
