# Datalab 04: Discussion

This data-lab day will focus on describing and understanding the data on a deeper level: interpreting the data distribution and the summary statics in the context of our research question. Then we will propose an analysis to answer that research question.

Learning objectives:
- understanding and interpreting real-world descriptive Datalab;
- judge which analysis is best suited to address a research question.


Table of contents:
1. Mock Assessment Recap: 1 hour
2. Project: 7 hours (but probably much shorter; 8 hours is the allocated time)


### Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask a member of staff if you can't figure it out together!

### Stand-up
Get together with a group of 5 and take turns answering the following questions:
- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Are there any impediments in your way?

Good luck!

## 0) Mock Assessment recap
Now, let's all find a partner and get our 3 mock-assessments out and discuss them. Specifically, analyse and evaluate one another's answers to the questions. If you both have the same answers, you're done. If not, then try to see who is right by explaining it to one another. If you both don't have an answer on a particular question; ask your instructor(s) in Datalab.

## 1) Feedback on dashboard
Now it's time to gather the feedback on your dashboard. Ask you mentor(s) to provide you with feedback or to book a slot so they can provide you with feedback your progression. Record the feedback with action points in your notes file and then continue with the next section or go ahead and make changes to your dashboard.

## 2) Considerations in interpreting the data
Now, it's time to put all the knowledge we gained into practice by writing the discussion section of our dashboard!

Tip: Domain knowledge is ofter key to interpretating the data! Get your research out again and connect the dots! Make sure to reference them in your dashboard and make sure to evidence your knowledge-sharing/help in your learning- and worklog!

***Open your dashboard and inspect the Discussion section. Next, open R-studio and open your script.***

We start with considering the distribution of the data, the summary statistics and data visualisations. What do they tell us about themselves? How do they relate to the research question?
1. Give an unbiased report of the possible considerations (e.g. Missing data, distribution, collection concerns, domain problems etc.) in interpreting the findings of the EDA.
2. Check if the provided considerations need to be supplemented with domain knowledge.


## 3) Recommendations for future analyses & data-driven decisions:
Now that we have interpreted the data distribution and summary statistics, it's time to consider how we could use our data to answer our research question.
1. Which analysis do you propose to run on the data? Form an unbiased judgement on the considerations. You can suggest multiple analyses as well if you can supplement your recommendation.

Tip: Get the Gold challenge by actually doing a correlational or linear regression analysis in Power BI. For this challenge you'll have to find a way to do that without any instruction from us! Make sure to reference that instruction and evidence you analysis in your dashboard and learning log!</a> article.

## 4) In-Class discussion
At 16:00, we'll all get together in Datalab to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Next week, we will start diving into reporting and data visualisation practices.
