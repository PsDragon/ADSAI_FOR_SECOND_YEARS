# Datalab 04: Discussion

This data-lab day will focus on describing and understanding the data on a deeper level: interpreting the data distribution and the summary statics in the context of our research question. Then we will propose an analysis to answer that research question.

Learning objectives:
- understanding and interpreting real-world descriptive data;
- judge which type of analysis is best suited to address a research question.


Table of contents:
0. Datalab Preparation Review: 1 hour
1. Feedback on Dashboard (optional): 15 minutes.
2. Project: 7~ hours (but probably much shorter; 8 hours is the allocated time)


### Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask a member of staff if you can't figure it out together!

### Stand-up
Get together with your mentor group, a student will lead the session, and take turns answering the following questions:
- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Are there any impediments in your way?

Good luck!

## 0) Datalab Preparation Review
Now, let's all find 5 partners from our mentor group and get our 3 Datalab Preparation files out and discuss them. Specifically, analyse and evaluate one another's answers to the questions. If you all have the same answers for the variability excercises and the same correlation coefficient, you're done checking those exercises. If not, then try to see who is right by explaining it to one another and discussion it. If you both don't have an answer on a particular question or just want to check to be sure; ask your instructor(s) in Datalab because they have the answer sheets.

Take your time to explain and justify your proposed correlational and linear regression analysis. Be critical and open to help one another to iterate on your analyses!

## 1) Feedback on dashboard (optional)
Collecting feedback on your work is an essential part of iterating; improving on your work, and iteration will be a recurring theme. Ask you mentor(s) to provide you with feedback on your dashboard or to book a slot so they can provide you with feedback on your progression. Record the feedback with action points in your notes file and then continue with the next section or go ahead and make changes to your dashboard.

## 2) Considerations in interpreting the data
Now, it's time to put all the knowledge we gained into practice by writing the discussion section of our dashboard!

Tip: Domain knowledge is often key to interpretating the data! Get your research out again and connect the dots! Make sure to save your information sources by saving the links in your dashboard (the Introduction contains a references section) or storing the sources as files on github.

***Open your dashboard and inspect the Discussion section.***

We start with considering the distribution of the data, the summary statistics and data visualisations. What do they tell us about the data? How do they relate to the problem statement and research question?
1. Give an unbiased report of the possible considerations (e.g. Missing data, distribution, collection concerns, domain problems etc.) in interpreting the findings of the EDA.
2. Check if the provided considerations need to be supplemented with domain knowledge.


## 3) Recommendations for future analyses & data-driven decisions:
Now that we have interpreted the data distribution and summary statistics, it's time to consider how we could use our data to answer our research question. You already practised doing this by proposing correlational and linear regression analyses yesterday. Now, we're going to create a first draft of an correlational or linear regression analysis proposal for our dashboard:
1. Which analysis do you propose to run on the data? Form an unbiased judgement on the considerations. You can suggest multiple analyses as well if you can supplement your recommendation. The analysis you proposed yesterday can in many cases simply be tuned to fit this part of the dashboard!

Tip: Get the Gold challenge by actually doing a correlational or linear regression analysis in Power BI. For this challenge you'll have to find a way to do that without any assistance from us! We provided you with some tutorials yesterday you could use. Make sure to reference which instruction you used and evidence your analysis in your dashboard and learning log!

## 4) In-Class discussion
At 16:00, we all (entire Year 1) get together in Datalab to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Tomorrow, we will dive into reporting and better data visualisation practices!
