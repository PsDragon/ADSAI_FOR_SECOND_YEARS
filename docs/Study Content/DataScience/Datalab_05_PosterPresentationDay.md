# Datalab 05: Poster Presentation Day

Today we're doing a formative assessment of the poster presentations. So you can put some finishing touches on your poster today. Or, if you are finished, you can come in at 13:00 when the poster presentations start. At 12:00 today, the lecturers will get the latest version of your poster and print it, after which we'll hang them in our Data Lab room **(Hn0.015).** Then at 13:00, we start the presentations, and you're expected to present your own poster.

## 9:00 - 12:00 Finishing touches on your poster
You can still ask for feedback or help with any issues you're experiencing now! :)

## 12:00 - 13:00 Lunchtime
The lecturers will print the poster. We can do it for free. You can eat lunch; we will eat while printing. We promise not to spill food over the posters.

## 13:00 - 16:00 Poster representations
The lecturers will walk around and inquire about the posters. Then, the course instructors (Nitin & Bram) will give you feedback based on the content of your poster.

If the lecturers aren't reviewing your poster, walk around and look at the posters of you classmates. Give one another feedback: this enables you to learn for eachothers achievements and mistakes!

Some of the other lecturers may be present, and these will not know what your project is about. So be prepared to take them through it and answer their questions. In essence this translates to knowing what you are talking about with respect to the scope of your research project, so don't worry about this too much. It will, however, give you some valuable feedback on how to improve on your poster before you are officially assessed in week 9.


## Some tips
If an attendee or classmate asks you something, you don't know just say: "That's interesting; maybe we could look into that in future analyses."
Sometimes the things they say are simply too big in scope or addressing a different research question: they're asking what they find interesting. Then you can say something like:

"Good point; however, that is outside of the scope of this study, I'm afraid."

or

"Interesting thought, the purpose of this study is not however to [proposal from conversational partner] but to [your research question]".


Expectation management is an essential skill for most jobs, and ours all the more due to the complexity of the challenges we're working with: you can't always properly estimate when you will be ready or whether it will work. So it's important to keep expectations realistic when you are presenting your poster to your stakeholders. Later in the program, we will go into these project and team-related skills; for now, it's just meant to help your present.
