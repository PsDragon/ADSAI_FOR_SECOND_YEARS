# Datalab 05: Poster Presentation Day

Today we're doing a formative assessment of the poster presentations. You can come in at 10:00 instead of 9:00 in our Data Lab room **(Hn0.015).**, which is where the conference takes place. At 12:45 today, the conference is kicked-off by the SDG taskforce with a presentation. Then at 13:00, we start the presentations, and you're expected to present your own poster.

## 10:00 - 11:45 Poster Presenation tips & setting up
We will give you some tips on your poster in the form of a presentation, and down below. We'll also explain a bit about the process and scientific conferences. Then we'll go an hang-up the first round of posters. :)

### Some tips which aren't on the slides
If an attendee or classmate asks you something, you don't know just say: "That's interesting; maybe we could look into that in future analyses."
Sometimes the things they say are simply too big in scope or addressing a different research question: they're asking what they find interesting. Then you can say something like:

"Good point; however, that is outside of the scope of this study, I'm afraid."

or

"Interesting thought, the purpose of this study is not however to [proposal from conversational partner] but to [your research question]".


Expectation management is an essential skill for most jobs, and ours all the more due to the complexity of the challenges we're working with: you can't always properly estimate when you will be ready or whether it will work. So it's important to keep expectations realistic when you are presenting your poster to your stakeholders. Later in the program, we will go into these project and team-related skills; for now, it's just meant to help your present.

## 11:45 - 12:45 Lunchtime
No explanation need but be back in time.

## 12:45 - 13:00 SDG Taskforce presentation
Breda University of Applied Sciences has it's own taskforce. They'll come by and tell you a bit about them and engage you in a Q&A. Afterwards they'll attend the conference as an interested party!

## 13:00 - 16:00 Poster representations
About 5 of you will present your posters in 3 rounds:
- 13:00 – Conference Round 1
- 14:00 – Conference Round 2
- 15:00 – Conference Round 3 
If you aren't presenting your poster, walk around and look at the posters of you classmates. Give one another feedback: this enables you to learn for eachothers achievements and mistakes!

The SDG Taskforce and some of the other lecturers are present as well, and these will not know what your project is about. So be prepared to take them through it and answer their questions. In essence this translates to knowing what you are talking about with respect to the scope of your research project, so don't worry about this too much. It will, however, give you some valuable feedback on how to improve on your poster before you are officially assessed in week 9.

The course instructors (Nitin & Bram) will give you feedback based on the content of your poster which will be usefull to adjust your poster before you hand it in for grading in week 8 at 17:00 on GitHub.


## The end
That was all for Data Science 1! Hopefully you enjoyed the course and feel like you are well on your way to become a Data Scientist!
