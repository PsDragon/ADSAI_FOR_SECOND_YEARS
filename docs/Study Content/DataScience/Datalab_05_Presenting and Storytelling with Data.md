# Datalab 05: Presenting and Storytelling with Data

We've now learned everything we needed to know in order to finish our first data science project. All that's left is writing the conclusion and referencing any sources you may have used, like the webpage of the SDG indicators where you got your data. Once you're finished, you can use the remainder of your time to brush up on your dashboard or revisit part of the analysis like data visualisation or interpretation.

## Learning Objectives
1. Learn Data-Driven Story Telling Fundamentals;
2. Practise on your presentation skills.

Please follow the links below to continue the class:
0. Datalab Preparation Review: 0.5 hours
1. Feedback on dashboard: 0.5 hours
2. 10:00 - 12:00: Data-Driven Story Telling Fundamentals Lecture
2. 13:00 - 17:00: Presentation Skill Workshop

### Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask a member of staff if you can't figure it out together!

### Stand-up
Get together with your mentor group, your mentor will pick a student to lead the session, and take turns answering the following questions:
- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Are there any impediments in your way?

Good luck!

## 0) Datalab Preparation Review
Now, let's all find 3 partners and open the version of your dashboard before you made the changes made during the Datalab Preparation session, and also open our post-Datalab Preparation dashboard. Show them to your partner and explain the improvements you made, why you made them and how you made them. You analyse and evaluate one another's work: specifically the choices, the execution and the story they tell with their data visualisations.

## 1) Feedback on dashboard
Now it's time to gather the feedback on your dashboard. Ask you mentor(s) to provide you with feedback or to book a slot so they can provide you with feedback your progression. Record the feedback with action points in your notes file and then make changes to your dashboard or watch the video below and see if you can iterate on your dashboard further before continueing writing the conclusion!
