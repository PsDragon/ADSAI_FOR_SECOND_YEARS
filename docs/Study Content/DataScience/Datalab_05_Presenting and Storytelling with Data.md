# Datalab 05: Presenting and Storytelling with Data

We've now learned everything we needed to know in order to finish our first data science project. All that's left is writing the conclusion and referencing any sources you may have used, like the webpage of the SDG indicators where you got your data. We're going to wrap that up coming Monday. For now, we are going to work on telling a better story using our data before we summarise it into a conclusion! 

## Learning Objectives
1. Data-Driven Story Telling Fundamentals;
2. Practise on your presentation skills.

Please follow the links below to continue the class:
0. Datalab Preparation Review: .5 hours
1. 10:00 - 12:00: Data-Driven Story Telling Fundamentals Lecture
2. 13:00 - 17:00: Presentation Skill Workshop

### Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask a member of staff if you can't figure it out together!

### Stand-up
Get together with your mentor group, your mentor will pick a student to lead the session, and take turns answering the following questions:
- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Are there any impediments in your way?

Good luck!

## 0) Datalab Preparation Review
Now, let's all find 1 (or 2) partner(s) and open 'PRE_DataVisualisationDatalabPreparation' (the version of your dashboard before you made the changes/improvement suggestions of yesterday). Also open 'DataVisualisationDatalabPreparation' to view the dashboard which contains our improvements and suggestions for that. Show them to your partner and explain the improvements you made, why you made them and how you made them. You will analyse and evaluate one another's work: specifically the choices, the execution and the story they tell with their data visualisations. Record the feedback with action points in your notes file and then make changes to your dashboard or see if you can iterate on your dashboard another way!


## 1) Data-Driven Story Telling Fundamentals
Workshop take place from 10:00 - 12:00 in the Datalab!

Tip: Get the Gold challenge by actually doing a correlational or linear regression analysis in Power BI. For this challenge you'll have to find a way to do that without any assistance from us! We provided you with some tutorials on the 'Analysing Relationships between Variables' page you could use. Make sure to reference which instruction you used and evidence your analysis in your dashboard and learning log!

## Up next
Monday, we will write our conclusion and have a first full draft of our dashboard! We will also introduce you to the differences between explanatory and predictive modelling! Exciting stuff!


## Questions or issues?
If you have any questions, please first ask your peers or ask us in datalab!
