# Datalab 07: SDG Dashboard Conference

Today we're doing a formative assessment of the dashboards by presenting them at a conference. We start at 9:00 in our Data Lab room **(Hn0.015).**, which is where the conference takes place. At 9:30 today, the conference is kicked-off by dr. Frank Peters himself, and you're expected to present your own dashboard. During the day we will rotate places every 1,5 hours.


If you aren't presenting your dashboard, walk around and look at the dashboard of you classmates. Give one another feedback: this enables you to learn for eachothers achievements and mistakes!

The SDG Taskforce and some of the other lecturers are present as well, and these will not know what your project is about. So be prepared to take them through it and answer their questions. In essence this translates to knowing what you are talking about with respect to the scope of your research project, so don't worry about this too much. It will, however, give you some valuable feedback on how to improve on your dashboard before you are officially assessed in week 9.

### Some extra tips
If an attendee or classmate asks you something, you don't know just say: "That's interesting; maybe we could look into that in future analyses."
Sometimes the things they say are simply too big in scope or addressing a different research question: they're asking what they find interesting. Then you can say something like:

"Good point; however, that is outside of the scope of this study, I'm afraid."

or

"Interesting thought, the purpose of this study is not however to [proposal from conversational partner] but to [your research question]".


Expectation management is an essential skill for most jobs, and ours all the more due to the complexity of the challenges we're working with: you can't always properly estimate when you will be ready or whether it will work. So it's important to keep expectations realistic when you are presenting your dashboard to your stakeholders. Later in the program, we will go into these project and team-related skills; for now, it's just meant to help your present.


## The end
That was all for Data Science 1! Hopefully you enjoyed the course and feel like you are well on your way to become a Data Scientist!
