# Datalab 07: SDG Dashboard Conference

Today we're doing a formative assessment of the dashboards by presenting them at a conference. Presenting your dashboard is the perfect way to see how good you were able to describe and visualise the data you used for your research! 
We start at 9:00 in the Production House **(Fs3.002).**, which is where the conference takes place. At 9:15 today, the conference is kicks off and you're expected to present your own dashboard. During the day we will rotate places every 75 minutes.

If you aren't presenting your dashboard, walk around and look at the dashboard of your classmates. Give one another feedback both verbally **and by using the questionnaire(!!)**: this enables you to learn for eachothers achievements and mistakes!

The client; the SDG HUB, and some of the other lecturers are present as well, and these will not know what your project is about. So be prepared to take them through it and answer their questions. In essence this translates to knowing what you are talking about with respect to the scope of your research project, so don't worry about this too much. It will, however, give you some valuable feedback on how to improve on your dashboard before you are officially assessed in week 9.

## Round 1
Presenting group: 1 & 2 (first half), and first quarter of group 5.
- 9:00 - 9:15 Setting up of Dashboards
- 9:15 - 10:30 Dashboard Presenation: Walk around, scan the QR codes of your peers and provide them with feedback using the questionnaire!

## Round 2
Presenting group: 3 & 4 (first half), and second quarter of group 5.
- 10:30 - 10:45 Setting up of Dashboard
- 10:45 - 12:00 Dashboard Presenation: Walk around, scan the QR codes of your peers and provide them with feedback using the questionnaire!

## 12:00 - 13:00 Lunchtime
No explanation need but be back in time. If you present your dashboard at 13:15, being back at 13:00 is vital to setup your dashboard presentation!

## Round 3
Presenting group: 1 & 2 (second half), and third quarter of group 5.
- 13:15 - 13:00 Setting up of Dashboard
- 13:15 - 14:30 Dashboard Presenation: Walk around, scan the QR codes of your peers and provide them with feedback using the questionnaire!

## Round 4
Presenting group: 3 & 4 (second half), and last quarter of group 5.
- 14:30 - 14:45 Setting up of Dashboard
- 14:45 - 16:00 Dashboard Presenation: Walk around, scan the QR codes of your peers and provide them with feedback using the questionnaire!

### Some extra tips
If an attendee or classmate asks you something, you don't know just say: "That's interesting; maybe we could look into that in future analyses."
Sometimes the things they say are simply too big in scope or addressing a different research question: they're asking what they find interesting. Then you can say something like:

"Good point; however, that is outside of the scope of this study, I'm afraid."

or

"Interesting thought, the purpose of this study is not however to [proposal from conversational partner] but to [your problem statement/research question]".


Expectation management is an essential skill for most jobs, and ours all the more due to the complexity of the challenges we're working with: you can't always properly estimate when you will be ready or whether it will work. So it's important to keep expectations realistic when you are presenting your dashboard to your stakeholders. Later in the program, we will go into these project and team-related skills; for now, it's just meant to help your present.


## The end
That was all for Data Science 1! Hopefully you enjoyed the course and feel like you are well on your way to become a Data Scientist!
