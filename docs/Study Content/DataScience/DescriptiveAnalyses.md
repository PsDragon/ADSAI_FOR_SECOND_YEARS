# Descriptive Analyses & Visualisations

We start of with a comfortable introduction to TOPICS by lecture. Subsequently, we will focus on putting our new knowledge into practice by XXXXXXXXXXXXXX. In the workshop you will be introduced to YYYYYYYYYYY.

## 0) Learning Objectives
Fundamental of Exploratory Data Analysis, specifically you will learn to understand and apply:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Descriptive statistics: Measures of central tendancy and spread
3. Descriptive visualisations

Please follow the links below to continue the classs:

### Step 1
Download the R swirl course [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://swirlstats.com/scn/getclean.html) by running the following code in the R-studio console:
```R
swirl::install_course("Getting and Cleaning Data")
```

Complete module 1.

### Step 2
Download the R swirl course [Data Analysis](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses/tree/master/Data_Analysis) lessons directly from the Swirl Git repo and install the lessons manually. Then complete all 3 modules: Central Tendancy, Data Visualisation and Dispersion.

### Step 3
Download the R swirl course [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://swirlstats.com/scn/getclean.html) by running the following code in the R-studio console:
```R
swirl::install_course("Exploratory Data Analysis")
```

Complete module 1 to 5


That was it for today, tomorrow we'll continue until module 10 and then we'll perform an exploratory data analysis on the data for our project statement.
