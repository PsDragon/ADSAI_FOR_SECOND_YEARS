# Descriptive Analyses & Visualisations

We start with an introduction to descriptive statistics and visualising descriptive data. Subsequently, in the workshop we will briefly focus on data cleaning, specifically getting and cleaning data; crucial for datalab tomorrow. For the rest of the workshop, we will practice doing exploratory data analyses wherefore descriptive statistics and visualisations are fundamental.

## 0) Learning Objectives
Fundamentals of Exploratory Data Analysis, specifically you will learn to understand and apply:
1. Data Cleaning: getting your data in the right shape to analyse.
2. Descriptive statistics: Measures of central tendency and spread.
3. Descriptive visualisations: Measures of central tendency and spread.

Table of contents:
1. Introduction: 1 hours
2. Workshop: 7 hours

We don't have a mock assessment today because we will practice on our own data in datalab tomorrow.


Good luck!



## 1) Introduction
First, we're going to explore how we can describe and interpret our raw data without analysing any causal relationships. In other words, we're going to look at what we can tell about the data by itself.
"Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire or a sample of a population. Descriptive statistics can be devided into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread)." ([investopedia, Retrieved 14-07-2021](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/descriptive_statistics.asp))

### Measures of Central tendency
These essentially describe the center of the dataset:

### Measures of Spread (or Variability)
Which describe the dispersion with the dataset:

### Data Visualisation
It's really helpful to visualise data: most people intuitively know how to read a graph but don't have a clue when given the same scientific relationships in writing or math. Visualising data allows us to use more of our sensory capacity, enabling us to learn and understand data better. Of all the data your 5 senses provides, the data your eyes provides is by far the richest dataset (80% of all sensory data used for cognitive processing).

Better yet is multi-modal perception of information; or data. Essentially, this is a fancy way of saying that you learn better if the information is presented in multiple ways and through multiple senses. Animation and text: multiple ways of saying the same thing. Animation and narration: multiple senses are giving the same or complementary information. Multi-modal perception is scientifically proven to improve learning and understanding. A prime example in data visualisations is explicitly allowing viewers to use their spatial awareness to understand concepts: like graphs or charts. Therefore, visual presentation of data is a game-changer to get a better understanding and intuitive feel of the data.

We have Renee Descartes with his cartesian coordinate system to thank for graphical representations of data as we know today: enabling us to use algebra to describe geometry. Or in other words: translate numbers using math into shape to represent the information contained in the data.

## 2) Workshop
Exploratory Data Analysis sadly takes a lot of practice, so that's what we'll do. You'll be looking up information, assessing, cleaning data and creating descriptive statistics and visualisations of data.

So let's get cracking!

### Step 1
Download the R swirl course [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://swirlstats.com/scn/getclean.html) by running the following code in the R-studio console:
```R
swirl::install_course("Getting and Cleaning Data")
```
Complete module 1: Manipulating Data with dplyr.

### Step 2
Download the R swirl course [Data Analysis](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses/tree/master/Data_Analysis) lessons directly from the Swirl Git repo and install the lessons manually. Then complete all 3 modules: Central Tendency, Data Visualisation and Dispersion.


# 3)  In-Class discussion
At 16:00, there's a online meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.


## 4) The End
That was it for today, [tomorrow](https://vigilant-giggle-149c38cd.pages.github.io/Study%20Content/DataScience/Datalab_01_ExploratoryDataAnalysis.html) we'll continue until module 10. Then we'll perform an exploratory data analysis on our own data based on the problem statement and research question we made in the previous [datalab](https://vigilant-giggle-149c38cd.pages.github.io/Study%20Content/DataScience/Datalab_00_SDG_Indicators.html).
