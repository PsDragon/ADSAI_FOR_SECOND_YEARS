# Descriptive Analyses & Visualisations 1

Now that we're familiar with handling data in Power BI, it's time we start to really understand and convey our understanding; describe it. That's why we will cover descriptive statistics and visualising descriptive data; commonly refered to as doing a Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Subsequently, in the workshop, we will briefly focus on data cleaning, specifically getting and cleaning data, crucial for data lab tomorrow. For the rest of the workshop, we will practice doing exploratory data analyses wherefore descriptive statistics and visualisations are fundamental.

## 0) Learning Objectives
Fundamentals of Exploratory Data Analysis, specifically you will learn to understand and apply:
1. Data Cleaning: getting your data in the right shape to analyse.
2. Descriptive statistics: Measures of central tendency and spread.
3. Descriptive visualisations: Measures of central tendency and spread.

Table of contents:
1. Introduction: 1 hour
2. Workshop: 6 hours
3. Mock-Assignment: 0.5 hours


Good luck!

## 1) Introduction
First, we will explore how we can describe and interpret our raw data without analysing any causal relationships. In other words, we're going to look at what we can tell about the data by itself.
"Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive [coefficients](https://youtu.be/V3HejxzKIR8) that summarise a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire or a sample of a population. Descriptive statistics can be divided into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (or spread)." ([investopedia, Retrieved 14-07-2021](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/descriptive_statistics.asp))

### Measures of Central tendency
These essentially describe the center of the dataset:

### Measures of Spread (or Variability)
Which describe the dispersion with the dataset:

## 2) Workshop
Now it's time for the [the workshop part](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/exploratory-data-analysis-in-power-bi) of this class to get acquainted with performing an EDA. We do this by solving a use case for which we have to do understand, clean, transform and visualise the data in a dashboard. Click the link in the previous sentence to start with the online workshop. Complete the entire course and upload the certificate to github, reference the certificate in your learning log for this week.

If you get stuck, first ask your peers and then us!

## 3) Datalab Prepration
For datalab tomorrow, you'll need to have finished all workshop modules up to this point. Make sure you all uploaded all certificates to github and referred to it in your learning log!

## The End
That was it for today; tomorrow, we'll continue until module 10. Then we'll look further into data visualisations specifically.
