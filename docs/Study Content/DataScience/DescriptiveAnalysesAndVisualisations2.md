# Descriptive Analyses & Visualisations 2

Now that we're familiar with handling data in Power BI, it's time we start to really understand and convey our data understanding; describe it. That's why we will cover descriptive statistics and visualising descriptive data; a crucial part of doing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Subsequently, in the workshop, we will focus on describing the data by visualising it.

## 0) Learning Objectives
Fundamentals of Exploratory Data Analysis, specifically you will learn to understand and apply:
1. Data Cleaning: getting your data in the right shape to analyse.
2. Descriptive statistics: Measures of central tendency and spread.
3. Descriptive visualisations: Measures of central tendency and spread.

Table of contents:
1. Introduction: 1 hour
2. Workshop: 6 hours
3. Datalab Preparation: - hours


Good luck!

## 1) Introduction
First, we will explore how we can describe and interpret our raw data without analysing any causal relationships. In other words, we're going to look at what we can tell about the data by itself.

### Data Visualisation
It's really helpful to visualise data: most people intuitively know how to read a graph but don't have a clue when given the same scientific relationships in writing or mathematical equations. Visualising data allows us to use more of our sensory capacity, enabling us to learn and understand data better. Of all the data your 5 senses provide to your brain, your eyes provide by far the richest dataset (80% of all sensory data used by the brain for cognitive processing).

Better yet is multi-modal perception of information; or data. Essentially, this is a fancy way of saying that you learn better if the information is presented in multiple ways and through multiple senses. Animation and text: multiple ways of saying the same thing. Animation and narration: multiple senses are giving the same or complementary information. Multi-modal perception is scientifically proven to improve learning and understanding. A prime example in data visualisations is explicitly allowing viewers to use their spatial awareness to understand concepts: like graphs or charts. Therefore, the visual presentation of data is a game-changer to get a better understanding and intuitive feel of the data.

We (mostly) have Renee Descartes with his [cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) to thank for graphical representations of data as we know today: enabling us to use algebra to describe geometry. Or in other words: translate numbers using math into a shape to represent the information contained in the data. Below are two great explainers about data visualisation, watch them before starting the workshop!

## 2) Workshop
Now that we're familliar with handling and exploring data; doing an EDA, it's time we learn to convey our data understanding better by learning how to make good data visualisations. Click here for the [the workshop on Data Visualisation in Power BI](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-visualization-in-power-bi). Complete the entire course and upload the certificate to github, reference the certificate in your learning log for this week.

If you get stuck, first ask your peers and then us!

## 3) Datalab Prepration
For the upcoming datalab, you'll need to have finished all workshop modules up to this point. Make sure you all uploaded all certificates to github and referred to it in your learning log!
