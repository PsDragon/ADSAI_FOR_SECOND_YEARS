# Intro into Regression and Machine Learning
Today is a sneak peak into next block: an introduction into machine learning and all kinds of regression and classification fun. So, today we'll explore linear regression models and machine learning models. There are video and text explanations followed by some excircises and a short mock-exam.

Learning objectives:
- Basics of machine learning;
- Basics of linear regression.

Table of contents:
1. Linear regression: 2 hours
2. Machine learning: 2 hours
3. Mock Assessment: 1 hour


Good luck!


## 1) Intro to Regression
Today we're going to introduce one of the most flexible statistical tools - the General Linear Model (or GLM). GLMs allow us to create many different models to help describe the world - you see them a lot in science, economics, and politics. Today we're going to build a hypothetical model to look at the relationship between likes and comments on a trending YouTube video using the Regression Model. We'll be introducing other popular models over the next few episodes.

Download the R swirl course [Regression_Models](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses) by running the following code in the R-studio console:
```R
swirl::install_course("Regression_Models")
```
Complete module 1.

## 2) Intro to machine learning
We've talked a lot about modeling data and making inferences about it, but today we're going to look towards the future at how machine learning is being used to build models to predict future outcomes. We'll discuss three popular types of supervised machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Linear discriminant Analysis (or LDA) and K Nearest Neighbors (or KNN).

Today we're going to discuss how machine learning can be used to group and label information even if those labels don't exist. We'll explore two types of clustering used in Unsupervised Machine Learning: k-means and Hierarchical clustering, and show how they can be used in many ways - from book suggestions and medical interventions, to giving people better deals on pizza!

Comlete Codecademy module [6. Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/analyze-data-with-r) of the 'Analyze Data with R' Skill Path.

## 3) Mock Assessment
 Create an R Script called IntroIntoRegressionAndMachineLearning_[YourNameHere] and save it to the GitHUb Classroom folder of the same name in your repository:

Now we're going to try to come up with some analyses we can apply on our SDG Indicator dataset: preferably the data you use for your own project.
1. Formulate and justify a linear regression analysis in less than 150 words.
2. Propose a machine learning analysis in less than 150 words.

Bonus points if you actually run the analysis in R and deliver working code.

## Questions
In case you have any questions please first ask your peers or (when they don't respond timely) [ask us or notify us of any issues you're having](https://github.com/BredaUniversity/AAI-DM/issues/new) and make sure to include the name of the course, workshop and question you have or the problem you're experiencing.
