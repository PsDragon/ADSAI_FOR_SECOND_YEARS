# Intro to Statistical Inference
This page introduces you to statistical inference. First, we start with some video explaining to grasp some basic concepts. Then, in the workshop, we will put our new knowledge into practice by doing 5 modules of a swirl course. Finally, in the Mock Assessment we'll do our first correlational analysis by hand!

Learning objectives:
Build upon the basic understanding of data representations by learning to create data visualisations which are:
- Variance;
- Common distributions;
- Asymptotic Distributions;



Table of contents:
1. Videos: .5 hours
2. Workshop: 3 hours
3. Mock-Assessment: 2 hours


Good luck!


## 0) Introduction to statistical inference
When collecting data to make observations about the world, it usually just isn't possible to collect ALL THE DATA. So instead of asking every single person about student loan debt for instance, we take a sample of the population, and then use the shape of our samples to make inferences about the true underlying distribution of our data. It turns out we can learn a lot about how something occurs, even if we don't know the underlying process that causes it. So today, we'll also introduce the normal (or bell) curve and talk about how we can learn some really useful things from a sample's shape - like if an exam was particularly difficult, how often old faithful erupt, or if two types of runners participate in marathons!

## 1)  Workshop
Download the R swirl course [Statistical_Inference](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses) by running the following code in the R-studio console:
```R
swirl::install_course("Statistical_Inference")
```
Complete modules 6 to 8. Makes sure to examine the PowerPoint presentations the course asks you to open; it's useful to have different explanations of the same thing. It helps you learn: neurons that wire together, fire together. In essence, consuming multiple examples enables you to connect concepts in your brain, making it easier to recall that information.




# 3)  In-Class discussion
At 16:00, there's an online meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

That's it for today! Tomorrow we're going to learn how we can analyse different relationships between variables.
