# Intro to Variables and Dataframes

We start of with a brief recap of what we learned in the [Intro to R](https://vigilant-giggle-149c38cd.pages.github.io/Study%20Content/DataScience/IntroToR.html). After that we are going to learn about and work with different types of variables and data frames to TOPICS by lecture. Subsequently, we will focus on putting our new knowledge into practice by creating your own toy data-frame.

## 0) Learning Objectives:
Enable you to understand, manipulate and create:
1. variables
2. vectors
3. dataframes

Please follow the links below to continue the classs:
1. Intoduction to concepts: 1 hour
2. Workshop: 6 hours
3. Mock-Assessment: 1 hours


Good luck!

In case you have any questions please first ask your peers or (when they don't respond timely) [ask us or notify us of any issues you're having](https://github.com/BredaUniversity/AAI-DM/issues/new) and make sure to include the name of the course, workshop and question you have or the problem you're experiencing.

## 1) Introduction
### 1.1 Variables
The video covers the fundamental concepts of variables from a mathemathical perspective.

The next video zooms into the descpline of data & computer science; more specifically: how variables work in R.

### 1.2 vectors
Whereas a variable stores a single value, a vector stores multiple values of the same kind in one dimension.

### 1.2 Matrices
Whereas a vector stores multiple values in a single dimension, matrices store multiple values in *two* dimensions. So it's essential a table, it's exciting stuff.

### 1.4 Dataframes
And finally there's the dataframe which can store different types of data in two dimensions.

## 2) Workshop - Variables, Vectors and Dataframes

Install the following course and do the modules 1, 4 and 7.

```R
  > swirl::install_course("R Programming")
```

 In case you have any questions first ask your peers before you [ask us or notify us of any issues you're having](https://github.com/BredaUniversity/AAI-DM/issues/new) regarding the studie content. Make sure to include the name of the year, block and github page in the title when you report the issue or question.

# Data Science X, Self-Study Day X: Mock-Assesment - TOPIC

This mock-assessment is about applying the concepts we learned today to the real-world. Today we're interested in your day, what did you have for lunch or breakfast for example? Sounds straightforward right?

Create an R-script following these instructions:

1. Create a variable called 'lunch' with a string describing an item you had for lunch: food only
2. Delete the variable
3. Create a vector named 'drinks' listing all you drinks you ate today
4. Create a vector named 'foods' listing all you food you ate today
5. Create a matrix containing the food and drinks you had today
6. Add the times when you ate or drank something

When you are finished with your mock-assignment you can upload your R-script on [github classrooms](HYPERLINK)

In case you have any questions left [ask us or notify us of any issues you're having](https://github.com/BredaUniversity/AAI-DM/issues/new) and make sure to include the name of the year, block and question you have or the problem you're experiencing in the title.
