# Intro to Variables and Data Transformation

We start with a brief recap of what we learned in the [Quantifying The World in Data](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/DataScience/Quantifying%20our%20world%20into%20data.html). After that, we will learn more about and work with different types of variables, vectors, matrices and data frames. Subsequently, we will focus on putting our new knowledge into practice by transforming data and creating our own toy data frame.

## 0) Learning Objectives:
Enable you to understand, manipulate and create:
1. variables;
2. vectors;
3. matrices;
5. Cleaning and transforming data.

Table of contents:
1. Introduction to concepts: 0.5 hours
2. Workshop: 5-6 hours
3. Mock-assessment: 0.5 - 1 hour(s)

## 1) Introduction

Let's start with the most basic container for information: the variable. Essentially it's just a container that contains a value that can change depending on a given condition. The following video covers the fundamental concepts of variables from a mathematical perspective.

A variable can contain numerous data types and a data type is necessary whenever you are dealing with the data. Any data that is loaded needs a data type so that it helps the compiler to understand how the data entered is to be used. Power BI is no exception. It also has a particular set of data types. Here, the data type is defined for a particular column. You can choose to learn by doing and do the workshop below, or you can first read this short overview first](https://yodalearning.com/tutorials/power-bi-data-types/#1) if you prefer to get a clearer overview of different types of variables; which I'ld recommomend but up to you! 

## 2) Workshop - Variables and Data Transformation in Power BI
Now it's time for the workshop part of of this class to get acquainted with variables and data transformation in PowerBI. Click the links [Introduction to Power BI](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-power-bi) and [Introduction to DAX in Power BI](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-power-bi). Complete the both courses and upload the certificate to github, reference the certificate in your learning log for this week.

## 3) Mock Assessment

This mock assessment is about applying the concepts we learned today to a real-world situation. Today we're interested in your day, what did you have for lunch and breakfast for example? You can also come up with some food or drink items instead if, for example, you didn't eat anything yet. Sounds straightforward, right? So let's get started!

Create an .pbix file called "VariablesMockAssessment" and follow these instructions:

1. Create a variable called 'lunch' with a text/string describing an item you had for lunch: food only.
2. Delete the variable.
3. Create a vector named 'drinks' containing all your drinks you ate today: as text/strings.
4. Create a vector named 'foods' listing all the food you ate today; as text/strings.
5. Create a table/matrix containing the food and drinks you had today.
6. Add the times; as numerical values, when you ate or drank something.

Save your mock assessment to your GitHub repository and refer to it in your learning log. In Datalab you and your classmates are going to look at one another's scripts and run it.
