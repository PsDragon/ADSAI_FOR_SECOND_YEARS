# Introduction to Probability
This page introduces you to probability theory. We start with some video explaining to grasp some basic concepts. In the workshop we will put our new knowledge into practice by doing 7 modules of a swirl course. There is no mock assessment this time because we have to cover 7 modules but we will apply our knowledge in Datalab instead.


## 0) Learning Objectives:
Enable you to understand and/or apply:
1. Addition rule;
2. Multiplication rules;
3. Conditional probability;
4. Law of Large Numbers;
5. Binomial Distributions;
6. Geometric probabilities;
7. Randomness;
8. Variance;
9. Expected values.

Table of contents:
1. Introduction to concepts: 1 hour
2. Workshop: 7 hours

Good luck!

In case you have any questions, please first ask your peers or [ask us or notify us in case you are experiencing any issues](https://github.com/BredaUniversity/AAI-DM/issues/new) and make sure to include the name of the year, course and github page.

Today we’re going to begin our journey into of probabilities. We’ll talk about how the addition (OR) rule, the multiplication (AND) rule, and conditional probabilities help us figure out the likelihood of sequences of events happening - from optimizing your chances of having a great night out with friends to seeing Cole Sprouse at IHop!

This film is going to introduce you to bayesian statistics and demonstrate how this new approach to statistics has revolutionized the field from artificial intelligence and clinical trials to how your computer filters spam! We'll also discuss the Law of Large Numbers and how we can use simulations to help us better understand the "rules" of our data, even if we don't know the equations that define those rules.  Don't worry, learning Bayesesian statistics is not part of this course.

Here Adriene Hill is going to discuss the Binomial Distribution and a special case of this distribution known as a Bernoulli Distribution. The formulas that define these distributions provide us with shortcuts for calculating the probabilities of all kinds of events that happen in everyday life.They can can also be used to help us look at how probabilities are connected! For instance, knowing the chance of getting a flat tire today is useful, but knowing the likelihood of getting one this year, or in the next five years, may be more useful.

Geometric probabilities, and probabilities in general, allow us to guess how long we'll have to wait for something to happen. Today, we'll discuss how they can be used to figure out how many Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans you could eat before getting the dreaded vomit flavored bean, and how they can help us make decisions when there is a little uncertainty - like getting a Pikachu in a pack of Pokémon Cards! We'll finish off this unit on probability by taking a closer look at the Birthday Paradox (or birthday problem) which asks the question: how many people do you think need to be in a room for there to likely be a shared birthday? (It's likely much fewer than you would expect!)

There are a lot of events in life that we just can’t predict, but just because something is random doesn’t mean we don’t know or can’t learn anything about it. This intructor is going to talk about how we can extract information from seemingly random events starting with the expected value or mean of a distribution and walking through the first four “moments”  - the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.

[Crash course](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q) makes some amazing educational videos on all kinds of topics, I highly recommend them for recreational use as well.

That's it for now let's continue with some interactive excercises!




### 1) Workshop
Download the R swirl course [Statistical_Inference](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses) by running the following code in the R-studio console:
```R
swirl::install_course("Statistical_Inference")
```
Complete module 1 to 7. Makes sure to open the powerpoint presenations the course asks you to open, it's useful to have different explanations of the same thing. It helps you learn: neuron that wire together, fire together. In essence consuming multiple examples helps you connect concepts in you brain making it easier to recall.

# 2)  In-Class discussion
At 16:00, there's a online meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Tomorrow, we're going to create some cool data visualisations for the findings section of our conference poster!

## Questions
In case you have any questions please first ask your peers or (when they don't respond timely) [ask us or notify us of any issues you're having](https://github.com/BredaUniversity/AAI-DM/issues/new) and make sure to include the name of the course, workshop and question you have or the problem you're experiencing.
