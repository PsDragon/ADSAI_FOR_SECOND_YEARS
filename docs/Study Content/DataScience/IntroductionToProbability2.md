# Intro to Probability 2
This page continues to build your foundational knowledge of probability theory. Yesterday, we introduced the foundational concepts, and today we will continue to put our new knowledge into practice by doing another case study. Finally, in the Datalab Preparation, we'll do our first correlational analysis by hand!

Learning objectives:
Enable you to understand and/or apply:
0. knowledge learned in previous modules
1. expected values;
2. variance;
3. common distributions;
to a guided case study.


Table of contents:
1. Workshop: 3-4 hours
3. Datalab Preparation: 1-2 hours

## 0) Workshop
Now it's time for the [the workshop part](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/case-study-analyzing-customer-churn-in-power-bi) of this class to practise our recently acquired skills in Power BI by doing a case study. We do this by solving a use case for which we have to do understand, clean, transform and visualise the data in a dashboard. Complete the entire course and upload the certificate to github, reference the certificate in your learning log for this week.

If you get stuck, first ask your peers and then us!


## 1) Datalab Preparation
The variance, unlike the mean, is a measure of variability. Meaning, it captures the amount of [spread within a variable or data set](https://youtu.be/R4yfNi_8Kqw). Measures of variability are often reported alongside measures of central tendency. Meaning, the variance is typically taken with the mean or the median, as this helps form a greater picture of what the data set looks like. Below are the formulas for the variance:

Take a piece of paper and calculate the following by hand:

1. Given the following information, find the **population variance**.

| Measure | Value |
| ------- | -------- |
| σ2	| 50 |
| μ | 4 |


2. Find the **sample variance** for age(i) of the following data:

| Subject | Age (i) |
| ------- | -------- |
| 1 | 29 |
| 2 | 30 |
| 3 | 31 |
| 4 | 45 |
| 5 | 28 |
| 6 | 26 |
| 7 | 25 |

Hint: What is the mean? Where do we plug it in? And what do we do then with that sigma notation, or sum notation, we learned last week?

3. Calculate the **sample variance** of the data sets given the following information:

Data set | Mean | SD | Sample Size |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
A | 715 | 55 | 1500 |
B | 634 | 42 | 2300

Photograph your calculations, name them "VarianceDatalabPreparation1" (if you have more photos, continue the count: e.g. 2,3,4) and upload them to your github repo.

# 2) Time left? 
Work on your dashboards!

That's it for today! Tomorrow we're going to learn how to analyse different relationships between variables.
