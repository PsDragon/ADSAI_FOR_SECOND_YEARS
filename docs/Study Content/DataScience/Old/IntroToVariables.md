# Intro to Variables and Dataframes

We start with a brief recap of what we learned in the [Intro to R](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/DataScience/IntroToR.html). After that, we will learn about and work with different types of variables, vectors, matrices and data frames. Subsequently, we will focus on putting our new knowledge into practice by creating our own toy data frame.

## 0) Learning Objectives:
Enable you to understand, manipulate and create:
1. variables;
2. vectors;
3. matrices;
4. data frames.

Table of contents:
1. Introduction to concepts: 1 hour
2. Workshop: 5 hours
3. Mock-assessment: 1 hour

Good luck!


## 1) Introduction
### 1.1 Variables
Let's start with the most basic container for information: the variable. Essentially it's just a container that contains a value that can change depending on a given condition. The following video covers the fundamental concepts of variables from a mathematical perspective.

The next video zooms into variables in the context of data & computer science; more specifically: how variables work in R.

### 1.2 vectors
Whereas a variable stores a single value, a vector stores multiple values of the same kind in one dimension.

### 1.2 Matrices
Matrices store multiple (usually  numeric) values of the same type in *two* dimensions arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns. So every row, or observation or element, contains a value for every collum.

The singular form of matrices is 'matrix'.

So it's essentially a matrix is a table with values of the same type. It's exciting stuff.

### 1.4 Dataframes
And finally, there's the data frame which is similar to the matrix but can store different types of data in two dimensions.

## 2) Workshop - Variables and Data Transformation in Power BI
Now it's time for the [the workshop part](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-power-bi) of this class to get acquainted with variables and data transformation in PowerBI. Click the link in the previous sentence to start with the online workshop. Complete the entire course and upload the certificate to github, reference the certificate in your learning log for this week.

## 3) Mock Assessment

This mock assessment is about applying the concepts we learned today to a real-world situation. Today we're interested in your day, what did you have for lunch and breakfast for example? You can also come up with some food or drink items instead if, for example, you didn't eat anything yet. Sounds straightforward, right? So let's get started!

Create an R-script called "VariablesMockAssessment" and follow these instructions:

1. Create a variable called 'lunch' with a string describing an item you had for lunch: food only.
2. Delete the variable.
3. Create a vector named 'drinks' containing all your drinks you ate today: as strings.
4. Create a vector named 'foods' listing all the food you ate today; as strings.
5. Create a matrix containing the food and drinks you had today.
6. Create a data frame from the matrix and add the times; as numerical values, when you ate or drank something.

Save your mock assessment to your GitHub repository. In Datalab you and your classmates are going to look at one another's scripts and run it.


# 4) Daily Q&A
At 16:00, there's a online meeting on our Microsoft Team Channel  you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Tomorrow we will cover descriptive analysis: what can we tell about the data by just looking at the data distribution and summary statistics?
