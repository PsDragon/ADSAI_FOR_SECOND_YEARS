# Quantifying our World into Data

We start of with a comfortable introduction to some basic concepts and tools. Today we will focus on how we can see and quantify our world into data. We are going to cover some basic concepts and apply those concepts to a mock assessment. In the workshop, you are introduced to R, an industry standard tool for statistical programming.

## 0) Learning Objectives
1. Enable you to quantify real-world phenomena and objects into data.
2. Enable you to use R-studio

## 1) General lesson structure
Each 6-8 hour self-study day is dedicated to a specific lesson which generally consists of the following components:
2. Lecture
3. Workshop
4. Mock-assessment
How each specific lesson is structured depends on the nature of the content and learning goals. Usually, these components can be found as separate Github pages, but these components can also be combined into 1, 2 or 3 pages. Today, for example, we will have a combined lecture & mock assessment of about 2-3 hours, after which we will have an introductory workshop of 1-2 hours.

## 2) More info?
Look at the creative brief for more info about the content or ask Bram or Nitin a question in teams or by mail.

## 3) Watch or attend the [opening lecture](https://img.freepik.com/vrije-vector/binnenkort-onder-constructie-geel-ontwerp_1017-26685.jpg?size=338&ext=jpg)
Time: Monday the 20th of September at 9:00 o'clock int the morning.
Place: Online on Microsoft Team: it should be in your agenda.

## 4) Mock-Assessment
Every workshop includes a small mock assessment to prepare you for the actual assessment deliverable you'll create in Datalab. In Datalab, you and your peers will look at and assess one another's work to check if you have understood or mastered the learning objectives. Don't get frustrated if you cannot satisfyingly answer some questions or are struggeling: we're just practicing a bit and using community learning to reinforce the learning experience during Data Lab.

A) Create a word or excel file named 'MockAssessment_QuantifyingTheWorldInData',  where you answer the following questions:

B) Questions: Defining objects as data

0. Choose an object to define: e.g. in your direct vicinity or something you like or want to understand better.
1. Describe the object formally in at least 100 words.
2. Quantify the object into (at least 10) variables.
3. Form a data-driven research question based on your variables and the formal description of the object.
4. Describe the background for your research question based on your research question, formal description, variables and other resources found online. References your sources using APA citation.

C) Questions: Defining phenomena as data

0. Choose a phenomenon to define: e.g. in your direct vicinity or something you like or want to understand better.
1. Describe the phenomenon formally in at least 100 words.
2. Quantify the phenomenon into (at least 10) variables.
3. Form a data-driven research question based on your variables and the formal description of the phenomena.
4. Describe the background for your research question based on your research question, formal description, variables and other resources found online. References your sources using APA citation.
