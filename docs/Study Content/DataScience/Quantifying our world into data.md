# Quantifying our World into Data

We start off with a comfortable introduction to some basic concepts and tools. Today we will focus on how we can see and quantify our world into data. We are going to cover some basic concepts and apply those concepts to a mock assessment. In the workshop, you are introduced to Power BI, an industry-standard tool for describing and visualizing data.

Make sure to hand in your Preparation for DataLab 5, Week 3 exercises by the end of the day (Mandatory!). Upload your work on github and insert the github link in your learning log for this week with a brief description. For details on staff availability, see [Project Brief](https://adsai.buas.nl/Year1/BlockA/).

## Learning Objectives
1. Enable you to quantify real-world phenomena and objects into data.
2. Enable you to use Power-BI

### Table of contents:
1. Introduction to DS Science Kick-Off: 1 hour
2. Mock-Assessment: 1 hour
3. Workshop: 4 hours

### More info?
Look at the [creative brief](https://adsai.buas.nl/Year1/BlockA/) for more info about the content or ask us during the Q&A in datalab tomorrow!

#### Don't know a specific word?
Don't worry about it and just google it! You're here to learn and expand your the vocabulary as part of your knowledge and skills!

## Questions or issues?

If you have questions or issues regarding the course material, please fill out the 'How Can We Help?' form under the section ['Ask me anything'](https://adsai.buas.nl/Contact%20Us/). A member of our teaching staff will respond as soon as possible.

## 1) Watch or attend the opening lecture

###Time:
Monday the 19th of September at 10:00 o'clock in the morning.

###Place:
Online on Microsoft Team: it should be on your Teams Calendar. If not, [click here](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a17PMQMfR4ntX_bdV9TDCQMIh5dTyPJibns2Pp1g76Os1%40thread.tacv2/1631095566063?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%220a33589b-0036-4fe8-a829-3ed0926af886%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225cef929d-ecf9-4fca-bf12-bc5ee065fc99%22%7d).

### Missed the lecture?
**It is available [here](https://edubuas.sharepoint.com/:v:/s/2021-22AFGA1.P1ADSAI/EddFYP70KktJnK76DoEJjNwBqWguSJjUSILHBRc-Gfm93A?e=hj1VG8) now!** And, [Here is the link to the slides in case you want those too.](https://edubuas.sharepoint.com/sites/2021-22AFGA1.P1ADSAI/Shared%20Documents/General/Recordings/DS1%20-%20Lecture%201;%20The%20world%20in%20data.ppsx)

## 4) Mock-Assessment
**Mock-Assessments** test your knowledge and skills but **are not graded in any way.** Instead, they are small exercises which; similar to real assessments, test your capacity to use your knowledge:
- Apply: use your knowledge in new situations
- Analyze: draw connections among ideas
- Evaluate: Justify a stand or decision
- Create: Produce new or original work (although this is primarily done in projects though; because of workload considerations)

    <figcaption>It's based on Bloom's Taxonomy, so be aware that these are usefull steps to solidify your learning and we'll integrate it whenever it fits: time and effort wise.</figcaption>

Anyway, now we got that clear:

Every workshop includes a small mock assessment to prepare you for the actual assessment deliverable you'll create in Datalab. In Datalab, you and your peers will look at and assess one another's mock assessment to check if you have understood or mastered the learning objectives. So don't get frustrated if you cannot satisfyingly answer some questions or are struggling: we're just practising, reinforcing our knowledge retention and using community learning to reinforce the learning experience during Data Lab. The role of a univerisity is to provide a safe space to learn and fail :).

A) Create a text (e.g. microsoft word) file named 'MockAssessment_QuantifyingTheWorldInData',  where you answer the following questions:

B) Questions: Defining objects as data

0. Choose an object to define: e.g. near you or something you like or want to understand better.
1. Describe the object in at least 100 words.
2. Quantify the object into (at least 10) variables.
3. Form a data-driven research question based on your variables and the description of the object.


C) Questions: Defining phenomena as data

0. Choose a phenomenon to define: e.g. near you or something you like or want to understand better.
1. Describe the phenomenon in at least 100 words.
2. Quantify the phenomenon into (at least 10) variables.
3. Form a data-driven research question based on your variables and the description of the phenomena.


Save the file as .txt or .pdf file to GitHub; we'll discuss it during Datalab tomorrow.

## Next step: Introduction to PowerBI
Now it's time for the [the workshop part](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-power-bi) of this class to get acquainted with PowerBI. Click the link in the previous sentence to start with the online workshop.
