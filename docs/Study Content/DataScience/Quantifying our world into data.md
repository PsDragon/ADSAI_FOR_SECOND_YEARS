# Quantifying our World into Data

We start off with a comfortable introduction to some basic concepts and tools. Today we will focus on how we can see and quantify our world into data. We are going to cover some basic concepts and apply those concepts to a mock assessment. In the workshop, you are introduced to R, an industry-standard tool for statistical programming.

## 0) Learning Objectives
1. Enable you to quantify real-world phenomena and objects into data.
2. Enable you to use R-studio

## 1) General lesson structure
Each 6-8 hour self-study day is dedicated to a specific lesson which generally consists of the following components:
2. lecture;
3. workshop;
4. mock-assessment.


How each specific lesson is structured depends on the nature of the content and learning goals. Usually, these components can be found as separate Github pages, but these components can also be combined into 1, 2 or 3 pages. Today, for example, we will have a combined lecture & mock assessment of about 2-3 hours, after which we will have an introductory workshop of 1-2 hours.

## 2) More info?
Look at the creative brief for more info about the content or ask us during the Q&A at 16:00 today!

#### Don't know a specific word?
Just google it, you're here to learn and master the vocabulary after all!

## 3) Watch or attend the [opening lecture](https://img.freepik.com/vrije-vector/binnenkort-onder-constructie-geel-ontwerp_1017-26685.jpg?size=338&ext=jpg)
####Time:
Monday the 20th of September at 9:00 o'clock in the morning.
####Place:
Online on Microsoft Team: it should be on your Teams Calendar. If not, [click here](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a17PMQMfR4ntX_bdV9TDCQMIh5dTyPJibns2Pp1g76Os1%40thread.tacv2/1631095566063?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%220a33589b-0036-4fe8-a829-3ed0926af886%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225cef929d-ecf9-4fca-bf12-bc5ee065fc99%22%7d).

## 4) Mock-Assessment
**Mock-Assessments** test your knowledge and skills but **are not graded in any way.** Instead, they are small exercises which; similar to real assessments, test your capacity to use your knowledge:
- Apply: use your knowledge in new situations
- Analyze: draw connections among ideas
- Evaluate: Justify a stand or decision
- Create: Produce new or original work (although this is primarily done in projects though; because of workload considerations)

Anyway, now we got that clear:

Every workshop includes a small mock assessment to prepare you for the actual assessment deliverable you'll create in Datalab. In Datalab, you and your peers will look at and assess one another's mock assessment to check if you have understood or mastered the learning objectives. So don't get frustrated if you cannot satisfyingly answer some questions or are struggling: we're just practising, reinforcing our knowledge retention and using community learning to reinforce the learning experience during Data Lab. The role of a univerisity is to provide a safe space to learn and fail :).

A) Create a word file named 'MockAssessment_QuantifyingTheWorldInData',  where you answer the following questions:

B) Questions: Defining objects as data

0. Choose an object to define: e.g. near you or something you like or want to understand better.
1. Describe the object in at least 100 words.
2. Quantify the object into (at least 10) variables.
3. Form a data-driven research question based on your variables and the description of the object.
4. Describe the background for your research question based on your research question, formal description, variables and other resources found online. References your sources using APA citation.

C) Questions: Defining phenomena as data

0. Choose a phenomenon to define: e.g. near you or something you like or want to understand better.
1. Describe the phenomenon in at least 100 words.
2. Quantify the phenomenon into (at least 10) variables.
3. Form a data-driven research question based on your variables and the description of the phenomena.
4. Describe the background for your research question based on your research question, description, variables and other resources found online. Refer your sources using APA citation.

Save the file to GitHub; we'll discuss it during Datalab tomorrow.

## Next step: Introduction to R
Now it's time for the [the workshop part](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/DataScience/IntroToR.html) of this class to get acquainted with R. Click the link in the previous sentence or next page to continue.

## Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask us in the daily Q&A at 16:00!
