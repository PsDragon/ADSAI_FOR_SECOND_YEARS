# Reporting and Visualising Data

We start by looking back at the goal we have for the poster presentation: in the context of the research challenge, not in the context of a student wanting to get a good grade. With the goal in mind we're going look at our report as a convincing narrative which we can supplement with helpful illustration: data visualisations. Then we'll start to dive into more advanced data visualisations and see if we can  use our newfound knowledge on our own data science project: the conference poster.

## Learning Objectives
Enable you to:
1. Compellingly report data and findings;
2. Make advanced visualisations with GGplot2 in R.

Please follow the links below to continue the classs:
1. Lecture: 1.5 hours
2. Workshop: 3 hours
3. Mock-Assessment: -


Good luck!


## 0) How do we report data?
Well, essentially you want to present your data; your model; your information, in such a way that it convinces the target audience. The following video wille xplain this in detail:

## 1) How do we visualize data?
Comlete module [Learn GGplot2](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ggplot-2) on Codecademy. If you feel like you master the GGplot2 sytax I recommend skipping chapter 1 "Learn R: Fundamental of Data Visualisation with GGplot2"

## 2) Mock Assessment
Look at the data visualisations you made for the conference poster. Do you see anything you'ld like to change? Anything that could help you tell a better story using the data? You can also change the poster lay-out if it helps you to tell a better story.

## 3) In-Class discussion
At 16:00, there's a online meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Next week, we will start diving into report and data visualisation practices.

## Questions
In case you have any questions please first ask your peers or (when they don't respond timely) [ask us or notify us of any issues you're having](https://github.com/BredaUniversity/AAI-DM/issues/new) and make sure to include the name of the course, workshop and question you have or the problem you're experiencing.
