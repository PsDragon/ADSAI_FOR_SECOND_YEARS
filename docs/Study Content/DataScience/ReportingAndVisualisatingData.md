# Reporting and Visualising Data

We start by looking back at our goal for the poster presentation: answering our research question. With that goal in mind, we will look at our report as a convincing narrative that we can supplement with helpful illustrations; or data visualisations. Then we'll start to dive into more advanced data visualisations and see if we can use our newfound knowledge on our data science project: the conference poster.

## Learning Objectives
Enable you to:
1. Make compellingly data reports;
2. Make compellingly data visualisations;

Please follow the links below to continue the class:
1. Lecture: 1.5 hours
3. Mock-Assessment: -


Good luck!


## 0) How do we report and visualise our data?
Well, essentially, you want to present your data, model, and information in such a way that it convinces the target audience. So letâ€™s start by do the course below. It explains in detail how to present your data; by telling a story:

Tip: If you are done early and you want to learn some extra fancy data visualisations skills: do module 8, 9 and potentially 10 as well of the Exploratory Data Analysis course in Swirl.

## 2) Mock Assessment
Look at the data visualisations you made for the conference poster. Do you see anything you'd like to change? Anything that could help you tell a better story using the data? You can also change the poster layout if it helps you to tell a better story.

## 3) In-Class discussion
At 16:00, there's an online meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Next week, we will start diving into report and data visualisation practices.


## Questions or issues?
In case you have any questions please first ask your peers or send us a message on teams instead!
