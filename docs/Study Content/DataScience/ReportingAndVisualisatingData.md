# Reporting and Visualising Data

We start by looking back at our goal for the dashboard presentation: answering our research question. With that goal in mind, we will look at our report as a convincing narrative that we can supplement with helpful illustrations; or data visualisations. Then we'll start to dive into more advanced data visualisations and see if we can use our newfound knowledge on our data science project: the dashboard.

## Learning Objectives
Enable you to:
1. make compellingly data reports;
2. make compellingly data visualisations.

Please follow the links below to continue the class:
1. Lecture: 3 hours (2* 1.5 hours)
2. More learning on visualisations: Optional
3. Datalab Preparation: 5 (on your own discretion) hours

## Questions or issues?

If you have questions or issues regarding the course material, please fill out the 'How Can We Help?' form under the section ['Ask me anything'](https://adsai.buas.nl/Contact%20Us/). A member of our teaching staff will respond as soon as possible.

Good luck!


## 1) Workshop: How do we report and visualise our data?
Well, essentially, you want to present your data, model, and information in such a way that it convinces the target audience. So let’s start by do the **entire** course below. It explains in detail how to present your data; by telling a story:

After the more general one, let's do one specifically taylored to PowerBI! [Click on this link to start the course](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/data-driven-story-power-bi/)

Save both your certificates to your GitHub repository and refer to it in your learning log.




## 2) Power BI: Advanced data visualisations
Now, the following videos, tutorials and courses allow you to go further than we ask if you fancy doing so. But by no means feel obliged to; we can't make it more clear than that: no pressure :). In the end, it's more important that you finish your dashboard and make sure that is all finished! And, you also need to have plenty of time to do fun stuff in your free time: a top priority as a student!

If you don't feel like it, continue to the Datalab Preparation, otherwise, anyway, here are our suggestions:

0. The learning path [Visualize data in Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/visualize-data-power-bi/) by microsoft is a great step-by-step guide which rewards you with a certificate and very useful and widely applicable!;
1. [Advanced Visualization Techniques For Power BI - Brand New Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6dY0bgRcE&ab_channel=EnterpriseDNA);
2. [Advanced visualization in Power BI – get the most out of your canvas with Henk Vlootman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwO9zNs0myM&ab_channel=BenHoward);
3. [A walk through of Power BI most advanced features through Star Wars data - Gil Raviv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Qk5V8dvgg&ab_channel=MicrosoftPowerBI)

Tip: Get the Gold challenge by actually doing a correlational or linear regression analysis in Power BI. For this challenge you'll have to find a way to do that without any instruction from us! Make sure to reference that instruction and evidence you analysis in your dashboard and learning log!</a> article.

## 3) Datalab Preparation
Create an Power BI file called "DataVisualisationDatalabPreparation". Here you should note down any improvement you make as a comment. Before you do so Create a second version with is called "PRE_DataVisualisationDatalabPreparation". This is the old one for comparison. You can also copy and paste bits of the internet to brush up your visualisation or to refer to as inspiration.

Look at the data visualisations you made for the conference dashboard. Do you see anything you'd like to change? Anything that could help you tell a better story using the data? You can also change the dashboard layout if it helps you to tell a better story.

Done? Create a third version with is called "POST_DataVisualisationDatalabPreparation" and upload your 3 files + any additiona ones to your GitHub repository.


Tomorrow, we will work on our conclusion section.
