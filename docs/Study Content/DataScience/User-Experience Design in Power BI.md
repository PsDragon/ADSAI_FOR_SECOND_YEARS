# User-Experience Design in Power BI
Today, we will take our data-driven story one step further and look at the user-experience design of our dashboard. Designing a user-experience is mainly distinct from a normal data-driven story in that the user has significantly more autonomy in how he views the story/data. In a [conference poster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poster_session) or research report there is a clear linear structure and the user cannot interact with the story/data/sliders/models. However, in a dashboard a user can change the dashboard; e.g. add a variable to a map, filter data, change model parameters, to see the information they're interested in: the user is essentially writing his own data-driven story! Your job is to guide this story, this user-experience, by designing it in such a way that the user is able to get valuable knowledge and insights from your dashboard! 

To achieve this, we're going to do this using a mini-course on Datacamp!

Please follow the links below to continue the class:
0. Workshop: 3 hours
1. Work on dashboard UX: 5 hours

## 0) Workshop User-Oriented Design in Power BI - Datalab Preparation
You know the drill. Go to datacamp and do the [Workshop User-Oriented Design in Power BI](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/user-oriented-design-in-power-bi)!

Upload the certificate to github and evidence it in you learning log.

## 1) Work on UX design Dashboard
Open your dashboard and save it as 'PRE_UX_Dashboard', upload it to github and evidence it in your learning log. Now, save your dashboard and name it 'UX_Dashboard_Iteration' and start improving the user exeperience of your dashboard based on the knowledge and skills you gained during the workshop. Save and upload the file to github when you're done. Evidence it in your learning log for this week along with a bullet point list of all the user-experience improvements you've made.

Finally, rename your dashboard back to it's original name ('SDGIndicatorsDashboard_YourNameHere', your name obviously goes somewhere here...) and upload it to github.

Also fill in your worklog! If your worklog and learninglog are lacking, work on them now; they're vital pieces of evidence without which you can't be graded! Remember that **the deadline for handing in the Dashboard is Thursday of week 7 at 17:00!**

## Datalab Preparation
- Conclusion section first draft
- References first draft
- Certificate User-Oriented Design in Power BI
