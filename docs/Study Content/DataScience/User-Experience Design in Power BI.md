# User-Experience Design in Power BI
Today, we will take our data-driven story one step further and look at the user-experience design of our dashboard. Design a user-experience is mainly distinct from a normal data-driven story in that the user has significantly more autonomy in how he views the story/data. In a poster or research report there is a clear linear structure and the user cannot interact with the story/data/sliders/models. However, in a dashboard a user can change the dashboard; e.g. add a variable to a map, change model parameters, to see the information they're interested in: the user is writing his own data-driven story! Your job is to guide this story, this user-experience, by designing it in such a way that the user is able to get valuable knowledge and insights from your dashboard! 

To achieve this, we're going to do this using a mini-course on Datacamp!

## 0) Workshop
[Go to datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/user-oriented-design-in-power-bi) and log in with your BUAS credential. 

## 1) Work on UX design Dashboard
Doesn't really need explaining right? Remember to save your changes to github and your learning log! Also fill in your worklog! If your worklog and learninglog are lacking, work on them now; they're vital pieces of evidence without which you can't be graded! Remember that **the deadline for handing in the Dashboard is Thursday of week 7 at 17:00!**

## The end!
Tomorrow we will look into user-experience design and work on our dashboard presentation for wednesday (mock-presentation to gather feedback).
