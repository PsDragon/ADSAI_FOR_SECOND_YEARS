# Regression

‘a measure of the relation between the mean value of one variable (e.g. output) and corresponding values of other variables (e.g. time and cost).’ 

>**Oxford Languages**	

Regression is widely used for prediction or forecasting where given one or more independent variables we try to predict another variable. For example, given advertising expense, we can predict sales. Given a mother's smoking status and the gestation period, we can predict the baby's birth weight.

There are many types of regression models, one source mentioning as many as 35 different models. An analyst or statistician must select a model that makes sense to the problem. Models differ based on the number of independent variables, type of the dependent variable and how these two are related to each other.

Regression comes from statistics. It's one of many techniques used in machine learning.



## Types of regression:

-	Linear 
-   Logistical
-	Ridge
-	etc.


## Common Software:
-	R
-	Python
-	SPSS
-	...

### Covered in Materials:

-	Importance is determined by a usefulness score provided by the students
-	Courses are selected from the online sources and labels are assigned to quantify which labels they cover
-	Hours spent ( or Q1 – Q3? or Mean, Median, Mode?):
-	Difficulty/Intensity: Determined by a slider 1 – 5  ? Or is it an aggregate?
-	Later we can maybe see who did which course and passed to see which ones are most usefull; use the other variables to explain more variation
-	Maybe then have a recommended order for those new to the topic? Or leave it free?



## Ideas:
-	Map all topics of the edison framework into a wiki of interconnected pages on github and use that as an information spreading system populated with content 
-	After doing a course the students can mark how many hours they spent and how intense the course was	

In some case it can be part of the reporting or worklog?
