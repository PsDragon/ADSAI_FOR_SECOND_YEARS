# Week 2, Day 1: Introduction to Deep Learning

Today, you will start learning deep learning! Before you start, make sure that you checked the [requirements](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/DeepLearning/21.%20Requirements.html) for this module.

## Learning objectives

After today, you should be able to:

- [ ] describe deep learning
- [ ] develop a basic neural network with Keras

## 1) Assignments for today

From the book [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition)
- [ ] Read Chapter 1: What is deep learning?

From the course [Introduction to Deep Learning with Keras](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-deep-learning-with-keras)
- [ ] Complete Chapter 1: Introducing Keras
- [ ] Complete Chapter 2: Going Deeper

## 2) Kickoff meeting at 15:00 [Online].

For the next four weeks, we will explore neural networks and how you can use them for your creative brief. This meeting will give you a high-level overview of the module. Then we will dive deeper into each week's content.

- [ ] Week 2: Multilayer Perceptrons using Keras
- [ ] Week 3: Multilayer Perceptrons without Keras
- [ ] Week 4: Convolutional Neural Networks with Keras
- [ ] Week 5: The Machine Learning Project Lifecycle
