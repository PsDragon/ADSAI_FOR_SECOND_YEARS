# Introduction to Deep Learning

In this module, you will learn about Deep learning. Deep Learning is a cutting-edge form of machine learning inspired by the architecture of the brain. TensorFlow is the most widely used deep learning framework, which when coupled with the Keras API and Python makes it easy to build, train, test, and tune deep learning models. Dive into deep learning to analyze large datasets and solve regression and classification problems.

## Learning objectives
- UNDERSTAND NEURAL NETWORKS : Get familiar with the underlying logic of how deep learning works.

- IMPLEMENT DEEP LEARNING MODELS : Create your own deep learning models using real-world data.

- EXPLORE COMMON USES OF DEEP LEARNING : See how deep learning is used in self-driving cars, deep fakes, and more.

- KEY BODY & KNOWLEDGE COVERED : Python, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, TensorFlow, Keras

## Good to have Prior Experience in
Some Python, NumPy, and machine learning

## There are four main units to this module

Foundations of Deep Learning and Perceptrons
Getting Started with TensorFlow

## After this Path, you will be able to:

Identify use cases for deep learning models
Implement a perceptron algorithm in Python
Preprocess data for various deep learning use cases
Build, train, and test deep learning models using TensorFlow
Tune hyperparameters to improve your models
Use regression models to draw predictions about data
Classify tabular and image data using deep learning models
Understand real-world applications of deep learning
