# Week 4, Day 1: Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks 1

Convolutional Neural Networks started the AI revolutional. By now you know what a neural network is. But what is a convolution?



Let's take a 3x3 array,

```
array_1 = np.array([[1, 0, -1],
                    [1, 0, -1],
                    [1, 0, -1]])
```
and convolve it over an image of our university.

```
from scipy.signal import convolve2d
output = convolve2d(image, array_1)
```

Here is the image and the output side by side.

`array_1` is called a kernel (or a filter).
