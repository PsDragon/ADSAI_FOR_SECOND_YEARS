# Week 4, Day 3, DataLab: Convolutional Neural Networks

Now it is your turn to create a CNN using Keras. There isn't any notebook for you to follow this time. Simply start a new notebook and name it `Creative-Brief-CNN.ipynb`. Load your creative brief dataset and build a CNN for it.

Make sure your model has at least one layer of each:
- [ ] Conv2D
- [ ] Dropout
- [ ] Dense
- [ ] BatchNorm
- [ ] MaxPooling

## Learning objectives

At the end of this DataLab, you should be able to:

- [ ] Build a CNN with Keras
