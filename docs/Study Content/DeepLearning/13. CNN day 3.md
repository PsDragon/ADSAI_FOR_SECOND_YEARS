# Week 4, Day 3, DataLab: Convolutional Neural Networks

Now it is your turn to create a CNN using Keras.

Make sure your model has at least one layer of each:
- [ ] Conv2D
- [ ] Dropout
- [ ] Dense
- [ ] BatchNorm
- [ ] MaxPooling

## Learning objectives

At the end of this DataLab, you should be able to:

- [ ] Build a CNN with Keras

## The DataLab notebook

Start working on the `Creative-Brief-CNN.ipynb` notebook.

You will use this notebook this week and the next week. You will see the following sections in the notebook:

1. The Dataset
2. Baselines
3. Preprocessing
4. CNN architecture
5. CNN training
6. Model performance
7. Error analysis

In this DataLab you will start with sections 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Load the dataset you selected for your creative brief and describe it (section 1). Preprocess the data so that it can be used to train a CNN (section 3). Build a CNN of your choice (section 4) and train it (section 5). Finally report your model performance by using suitable metrics and plots (section 6).

To better understand this process, take a look at the [example notebook](https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/2022-23-Y1-BlockC/blob/main/DataLabs/W4%20and%205/Creative-Brief-CNN-Example.ipynb) prepared on the MNIST dataset.
