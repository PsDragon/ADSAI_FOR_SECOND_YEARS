# Week 5, Day 1: The Universal Workflow of Machine Learning 1

Until now, you have focused on building deep learning models. However, model development is a single step in the whole life cycle of a machine learning project. This week your will broaden your view and look at project workflow.

This week during self-study, you will complete the online course [Introduction to Machine Learning in Production](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6GMoA0wbpJLi3t34Gd8l0aK) by Andrew Ng.

## 1) Review meeting at 10:00

We will review what you have learned so far and this week's material.

## 2) Steps in detail

Let's understand each step shown in Figure 1 in detail.

1. Define project: This involves understanding the context in which the problem exists and determining the specific goals of the project.

2. Define data and establish baseline: The next step is to gather the data that will be used to train the machine learning model. It is important to explore the data to understand its characteristics and any patterns that might exist. Establishing baselines are crucial in order understand model performance.

3. Label and organize data: Once the data has been collected, it needs to be cleaned and preprocessed in order to be used effectively in the machine learning model. This may involve things like handling missing values, normalizing features, and creating new features. Reliable labeling is key for reliable modeling.

4. Select and train the model: The next step is to train the machine learning model on the prepared data. This involves selecting an appropriate algorithm, defining relevant hyperparameters, and training the model.

5. Perform error analysis:  Once the model has been trained, it is important to evaluate its performance to determine how well it is able to make predictions on unseen data. This is done by assesing its discrimination and calibration performance. Moreover, it is important to calculate confidence intervals, check model errors and assess bias.

6. Deploy in production: If the model's performance meets the desired criteria, it can be deployed in a production environment where it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

7. Monitor and maintain system: After deployment, it is important to monitor the model's performance and make any necessary updates to maintain its effectiveness over time.

Developing an ML project is not a linear process, in which we move step-by-step from project definition to deployment. It is an iterative process, where during a later stage we might go back to an earlier stage.

## 3) The Universal Workflow of ML [Reading]

Before starting the course, study the relevant chapter from the book [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition):

## 4) The Machine Learning Project Lifecycle [Online course]

From the course [Introduction to Machine Learning in Production](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6GMoA0wbpJLi3t34Gd8l0aK), watch the videos number 1 to 4.

## 5) Deployment [Online course]

We will not cover deployment in this block. Nevertheless it is helpful to have an idea about this step, to better understand other steps. Therefore watch a single video and skip the rest of the vidoes on deployment.
