## 6) Human Level Performance (HLP)

Tomorrow in the DataLab, you will calculate the HLP for your project. Today prepare a form where each question is an image, and answers are class labels. Tomorrow, you will ask 3 of your peers to answer the questions. You will also answer the forms prepared by 3 of your peers.

- Use Microsoft Forms
- Click on the button **New Quiz**
- Give a proper title
- Add a form description, explaining your project briefly (number of classes, names of the classes, multi-class vs multi-label etc.)
- Add new questions of the type **Choice**
- Add a question such as **Guess the class?** and add an image to the question
- This is the image respondents will label
- If you have N classes, add N options in the form corresponding to each class
- Select the correct option(s), so that when you collect the answers HLP will be calculated automatically.
- Select **Required**
- If you have a multi-class problem, do not select **Multiple answers**
- If you have a multi-label problem, select **Multiple answers**
- Repeat this such that you have 10 images per each class.

Here is an example:
