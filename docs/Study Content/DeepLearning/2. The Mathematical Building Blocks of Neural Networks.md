# Week 2, Day 2: The Mathematical Building Blocks of Neural Networks

Neural networks are essentially dot products on a very large scale. You don't have to be a math genius to develop neural networks, but familiarity with mathematical concepts such as the dot product, matrix multiplication, derivates, gradients will help you understand neural networks better.

## 1) Assignment

From the book [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python)
- [ ] Read Chapter 2: The mathematical building blocks of neural networks

## 2) DataLab Prep

Please make sure you have the following chapters ready for tomorrow's datalab:

- [ ] Chapter 1&2 of the course [Introduction to Deep Learning with Keras](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-deep-learning-with-keras)
