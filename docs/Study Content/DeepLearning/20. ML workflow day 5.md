# Week 5, Day 5, DataLab: The Machine Learning Project Lifecycle

This week you have learned the machine learning project lifecycle in detail. As you know, you need to prepare a PowerPoint presentation of your project proposal. In this DataLab, let's apply what you have learned to this presentation.

**Figure 1:** The ML project lifecycle from [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)

Create a pptx file and create a slide for each step in the lifecycle. We haven't covered deployment step, therefore it is optional. In each slide, describe what you have done and discovered with respect to that step.

1. Define project
2. Define data and establish baseline: Include the baselines you created
3. Label and organize data
4. Select and train the model: Explain the technical aspects of your model, architecture, loss function, optimizer, learning rate...
5. Perform error analysis: Include discrimination metrics such as F1-score.
6. Deploy in production (Optional)
7. Monitor and maintain system (Optional)
