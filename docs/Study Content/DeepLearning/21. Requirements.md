# Deep Learning Requirements

In this page, you will find a summary of requirements related to deep learning.

## Deliverables

In this block, you will study deep learning for 4 weeks (Weeks 2-3-4-5). Here is the relationship between the weeks and the deliverables.
- Week 2: Multilayer perceptrons with Keras.
  - DataLab 1: `W2-DL1-MLP-Student-Notebook.ipynb`
  - DataLab 2: `W2-DL2-MLP-Student-Notebook.ipynb`
- Week 3: Multilayer perceptrons without Keras.
  - DataLabs 1&2: `W3-DL-MLP-from-scratch.ipynb`
- Week 4: Convolutional neural networks with Keras.
  - DataLabs 1&2: `Creative-Brief-CNN.ipynb`
- Week 5: The machine learning project lifecycle.
  - DataLab 1: `Creative-Brief-CNN.ipynb`
  - DataLab 2: Proof-of-concept slides of the Project Proposal presentation

In total, you are expected to deliver 4 jupyter notebooks. Additionally, you are expected to describe the final version of the proof-of-concept CNN model in the Project Proposal presentation. 

## ILO mapping

You can find the ILO mapping of the deliverables below:

- ILO 4.1 Poor: `W2-DL1-MLP-Student-Notebook.ipynb`
- ILO 4.1 Insufficient: `W2-DL2-MLP-Student-Notebook.ipynb`
- ILO 4.1 Sufficient: `Creative-Brief-CNN.ipynb` & Project Proposal presentation
- ILO 4.1 Good: `Creative-Brief-CNN.ipynb` & Project Proposal presentation
- ILO 4.1 Excellent: `W3-DL-MLP-from-scratch.ipynb`
