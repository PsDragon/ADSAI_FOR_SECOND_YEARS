# Scalars, Vectors, and Matrices

To start, let us go over a couple of topics that will be integral to understanding the mathematical operations that are present in deep learning, including how data is represented:

## Scalars: 

A scalar is a single quantity that you can think of as a number. In machine learning models, we can use scalar quantities to manipulate data, and we often modify them to improve our model’s accuracy. We can also represent data as scalar values depending on what dataset we are working with.

```python
x = 1
```

## Vectors: 

Vectors are arrays of numbers. In Python, we often denote vectors as NumPy arrays. Each value in the array can be identified by its index (location within the array).

```python
x = np.array([1,2,])
```

## Matrices: 

Matrices are grids of information with rows and columns. We can index a matrix just like an array; however, when indexing on a matrix, we need two arguments: one for the row and one for the column.

```python
x = np.array([[1,2],[3,4,]])
```

## Tensors: 

Scalars, vectors, and matrices are foundational objects in linear algebra. Understanding the different ways they interact with each other and can be manipulated through matrix algebra is integral before diving into deep learning. This is because the data structure we use in deep learning is called a tensor, which is a generalized form of a vector and matrix: a multidimensional array.

A tensor allows for more flexibility with the type of data you are using and how you can manipulate that data.



Let us visualize what they look like and how they can be expressed using NumPy arrays. Use the applet on this page to get a feel for a tensor’s structure and how it is represented!

In this applet, you are given boxes where you can fill in negative and positive whole numbers. On the right side is a set of nested arrays. These nested arrays form a 3-dimensional tensor that can be viewed as a “stack” or “layer” of grids, as shown on the left.

The shape of this tensor is (3, 2, 5), as outlined on the diagram. The shape of our data is an important factor when we are feeding it into our neural network. It affects the way our model interacts with our inputs.
