# Week 2, Day 3 (DataLab): Multilayer Perceptrons

It's time to put what you have learned into practice! In this DataLab you will develop Multilayer Perceptrons using Keras for different datasets. The DataLab is structured as a notebook file. You will see this format frequently in this Deep Learning module. To start the DataLab, open the file `W2-DL1-MLP-Student-Notebook.ipynb` and continue there.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this DataLab, you will be able to build MLPs using Keras for the following problem types:

- [ ] Regression
- [ ] Binary classification
- [ ] Multi-class classification
- [ ] Multi-label classification
