# Week 2, Day 4: Improving Model Performance

The ability to create a neural network is essential. But the ability to evaluate and improve model performance is even more so. Today and tomorrow, you will learn and apply the basics of model evaluation.

## Learning objectives

After today you should be able to:

- [ ] Compare Keras and TensorFlow
- [ ] Summarize the "Anatomy of a Neural Network" as explained in Section 3.6 from the book [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python)
- [ ] Interpret learning curves

## 1) Model evaluation

In order to improve model performance, you need to evaluate it first. You have seen how to use `model.evaluate()` to evaluate your models. But there are many metrics you can use to evaluate a model. Watch the following video to learn about the common metrics that are used to evaluate machine learning models.

Video 1: How to evaluate ML models | Evaluation metrics for machine learning

It is a good practice to implement a few metrics (e.g. accuracy, RMSE) yourself in Python/NumPy to test your understanding. But in practice you can use the metrics implemented in ML/DL libraries.
