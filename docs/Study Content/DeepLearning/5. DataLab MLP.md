# Week 2, Day 5 (DataLab): Multilayer Perceptrons - Deep Dive

In the previous DataLab, you developed MLP models with Keras. In this DataLab we will go into more detail on how to evaluate and improve an MLP. Open the notebook `W2-DL2-MLP-Student-Notebook.ipynb` and follow the instructions.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this DataLab, you should be able to:

- [ ] Plot and interpret learning curves
- [ ] Use early stopping in Keras
- [ ] Tune the learning rate
- [ ] Explain the relationship between learning rate and learning.

## Important note

There might be version differences in libraries we use (e.g. Keras). Therefore some code snippets that work for me, might require small changes to work on your setup.

For example, I used the following import
```python
from keras.optimizers import Adam
```
but with new tensorflow/keras versions, it might throw an error. In that case, try the following:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
```

check the [stackoverflow discussion here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62707558/importerror-cannot-import-name-adam-from-keras-optimizers) for more details.

This is just one example, you might encounter other similar issues in the future. Search for the error and update the notebook. Please let the mentors and your peers know as well.
