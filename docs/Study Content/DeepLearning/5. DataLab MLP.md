# Week 2, Day 5 (DataLab): Multilayer Perceptrons - Deep Dive

In the previous DataLab, you developed MLP models with Keras. In this DataLab we will go into more detail on how to evaluate and improve an MLP. 

Specifically you will:

- [ ] plot and interpret learning curves,
- [ ] use early stopping,
- [ ] and tune the learning rate.
