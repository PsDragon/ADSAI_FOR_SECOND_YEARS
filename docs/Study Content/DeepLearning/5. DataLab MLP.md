# Week 2, Day 5 (DataLab): Multilayer Perceptrons - Deep Dive

In the previous DataLab, you developed MLP models with Keras. In this DataLab we will go into more detail on how to evaluate and improve an MLP. Open the notebook `W2-DL2-MLP-Student-Notebook.ipynb` and follow the instructions.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this DataLab, you should be able to:

- [ ] Plot and interpret learning curves
- [ ] Use early stopping in Keras
- [ ] Tune the learning rate
- [ ] Explain the relationship between learning rate and learning.
