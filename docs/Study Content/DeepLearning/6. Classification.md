# Neural Network for classification

Today you will apply the deep learning concepts you have explored to learn a classification model. In this section, you will work with tabular data to diversify your deep learning skill set and gain an array of neural network concepts at your disposal. With these in hand, you will be able to work on a wider array of projects such as classifying pictures of galaxies! in upcoming weeks.

## Learning Objective:

- Use your deep learning knowledge to perform classification

## Implementing Neural Networks for Classification

For today, follow the course available on classification in Codecademy. 

You should follow the course and make notes of things you are learning in your own words in your **_DL-notes.docx_** file in your **_Block C Microsoft Teams assignment_**.

 Also, if you are using notebook other than Codecademy session, make sure you upload them to your Block C Github repository.

Codecademy Module : _**4. Classification**_

# Note

Do remember to visit your Block B notes on accuracy and [confusion matrix](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Responsible%20and%20Explainable%20AI/ResponsibleAI4.html?highlight=confusion%20matrix#1-introduction) in order to understand F1 better.
Then [read blog](https://www.milindsoorya.com/blog/confusion-matrix-in-machine-learning) to get a basic understanding of how to calculate F1-score
