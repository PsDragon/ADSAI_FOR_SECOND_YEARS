# Neural Network in Google Playground

Today's self study day you will be revisiting the concepts you have learnt over the past 2 weeks. Google Playground crash course provides with more detail explanation of the concepts using tensorflow.
In case you have pending things to do from yesterday's codecademy course, we advise you to complete codecademy first, and then go through this course.

Try to reflect upon and see for yourself whether you are completing the learning objective given in the course itself.
