# Week 3, Day 2: Neural networks from scratch

So far you have used Keras to build neural networks. Thanks to Keras, you can build a powerful network in a few lines of code. However this week you will
implement a simple neural network without deep learning libraries.

**Why would anybody wanna do this, when we have Keras?**

The aim is not to code a neural network for using in real problems. Please use deep learning libraries when you are working on real problems. The aim is to understand how neurals networks work at a deep level, and the best way to do that is to actually implement one.

**But why understading how NNs work is useful?**

If you have to build a neural network for the MNIST dataset, you can simply search and find a solution. But if you are building a network at work, you will
commonly encounter problems custom to your business setting where you cannot search and find an exact solution.
You can find similar solutions, or solutions for sub-problems. But this will require adjustments from your side.
Moreover, building a neural network is a highly iterative process with the aim of improving performance and reliability.
Finally, your stakeholders will question why you are doing things the way you do. You can do all of this much better if you understand how neural networks work.
