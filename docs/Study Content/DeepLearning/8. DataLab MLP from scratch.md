# Week 3, Day 3: DataLab

In this and the next DataLab you will work on a single notebook titled `W3-DL-MLP-from-scratch-Student-Notebook.ipynb`

Here is an outline of the tasks you need to achieve to implement an MLP from scratch.

- [ ] **Task 1**: Given an MLP architecture (e.g. `[2, 3, 1]`), define a function that returns random weights and biases around zero.

- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement the sigmoid activation function.

- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement the predict function.

- [ ] **Task 4**: Define a function that calculates accuracy.

- [ ] **Task 5**: Define a function that calculates mean square error (loss).

- [ ] **Task 6**: Define a function that implements a naive gradient descent algorithm.

In this DataLab complete Tasks 1 to 5.

On Friday you will focus on Task 6.
