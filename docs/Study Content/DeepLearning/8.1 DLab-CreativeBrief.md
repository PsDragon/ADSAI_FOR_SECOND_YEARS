For Today you will be continuing with Image classification using Convolution Neural Network. 

You can continue working with Codecademy CNN challenge project **_or_** work on gathering your image dataset for the creative brief requirements.  


Assignment 1  - **_Challenge Project_** - [Covid-19 and Pneumonia Classification with Deep Learning](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-deep-learning-models-with-tensorflow/tracks/dlsp-classification-track/modules/dlsp-classification-challenge-project/projects/covid-19-and-pneumonia-deep-learning-classification)

**OR**

# Data Lab - 7,8,9,10 : Working on Creative Brief 

From today's Data Lab onwards, working on the Creative brief requirements is also a good option. Read the Project Brief for more details.

Try to divide your work in 3 phases:

1) Implementing a image Classifier for your requirement

2) Use data augmentation techniques for your Classifier.

3) Use Transfer learning techniques for your Classifier.
