# Week 3, Day 4: Gradient Descent

Tuesday and Wednesday, you have learned how to build a multilayer perceptron. Today and tomorrow you will learn how to train this model. The algorithm to train neural networks is called gradient descent.

## 1) Assignments

Start the day with the following material by Grant Sanderson:

- [ ] [Gradient descent, how neural networks learn](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/gradient-descent)
- [ ] [Analyzing our neural network](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/neural-network-analysis)
- [ ] Please watch the video, read the text and answer the questions.


## 2) It is time to code!

You will learn how to implement a naive gradient descent algorithm for a machine learning model with a single trainable parameter. In reality, models will have many more parameters. But since we are using a single parameter, we can visualize the gradient descent behaviour. This will be very helpful for understanding the algorithm.

Here is the notebook. You will see exercises for you to complete. The solutions are also provided. But please try to solve by yourself first before checking the solutions.
