For today’s DataLab we have a lot of activities scheduled that will help you to create your final checklist.  We will begin with our general standup and after you will be asked to discuss the theme, you picked yesterday during the independent study day, with your mentor. In the meantime, you need to discuss the Rotterdam welfare benefits case with your peers. 

Once it’s done, start filling in the DEDA Framework for your theme.

## Questions or issues?

If you have questions or issues regarding the course material, please fill out the 'Ask me Anything?' [form](https://adsai.buas.nl/Contact%20Us/AskMeAnything.html). A member of our teaching staff will respond as soon as possible.

## 1) Q&A and Standup (9:15-9:30)

__1a__ Ask questions regarding the independent study material.

__1b__ Answer the following questions:

- What did I work on yesterday (including DataLab Preparation!)?
- What am I working on today?
- What issues are blocking me?

## 3) The Rotterdam welfare benefits case

Make groups of 5 within your mentor groups and discuss the Rotterdam welfare benefits case and answer the following questions together with your group:

1. How could Gementee Rotterdam avoid this from happening in the future?

2. Which mistakes did Accenture make?

3. Looking at the DEDA framework, which points were ignored while developing the ML algorithm for Gementee Rotterdam? 


Do not hesitate to ask feedback from your mentors as well.

## 4) Discussion with the mentor (5 -7 min per person)

During this discussion, you will be asked to present/discuss the theme you picked yesterday with your mentor. Explain why you picked a certain theme and why it is interesting for you. Note mentors feedback. 

## 4) DEDA Framework

Spend the rest of the day filling in the DEDA Framework for the theme.
