For today’s DataLab we have a lot of activities scheduled that will help you to create your final checklist.  We will begin with our general standup and after you will be asked to present (as well as discuss) your project proposal to your classmates. 

Once it’s done, start filling in the DEDA Framework for your problem statement.

## Questions or issues?

If you have questions or issues regarding the course material, please fill out the 'Ask me Anything?' [form](https://adsai.buas.nl/Contact%20Us/AskMeAnything.html). A member of our teaching staff will respond as soon as possible.

***

## 1) Q&A and Standup (9:15-9:30)

__1a__ Ask questions regarding the independent study material.

__1b__ Answer the following questions:

- What did I work on yesterday (including DataLab Preparation!)?
- What am I working on today?
- What issues are blocking me?

## 3) Presentations of your project proposal

Make groups of 5 peers within your mentor groups and present your project proposal. Once the presentations are done, discuss your project proposals in the group and give each other feedback. Thus, you need to open your notes file and take notes. Note down all valuable feedback in your notes file and upload it to your GitHub repository once finished and reference it in your learning log for this week. 

Do not hesitate to ask feedback from your mentors as well.

## 4) DEDA Framework

Spend the rest of the day filling in the DEDA Framework for your problem statement. In case you cant answer some of the questions without the help of municipality, click [this link]() to record your question to the municipality of Breda.
