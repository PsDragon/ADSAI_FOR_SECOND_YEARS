For today’s DataLab we have a lot of activities scheduled that will help you to progress further with your final paper and ethics.  We will begin with our usual stand up and after you will have a chance to review weeks 2 study material. After you will be asked to present (as well as discuss) your research findings on Twitter and GDPR to your peers. This mini presentation will prepare you for your final assignment (ethics part of it).
Once it’s done, you will be asked to go through the Nielson paper. We used this paper as an inspiration for this block. Therefore, reading this paper, will help you to understand the nature of this block’s assignment.
And finally, we will finish todays DataLab with amazing guest lecture by Dasha Simons from IBM. She will tell you everything about Ethics in AI.

Furthermore, today you will have your bi-weekly formative feedback session with your mentor (Further details to follow, see Microsoft Teams).

## 1) Q&A and Standup (9:15-9:30)

## 2) Review study material (Week 2) (9:30-10:00)

For details regarding prerequisites, contact your mentor. 

## 3) Presentations on Twitter and GDPR

Make groups of 5 peers within your mentor groups and present your findings to each other. Once the presentations are done, discuss your findings in the group and give each other feedback on the research findings. Thus, you need to open your notes file and take notes. Note down all valuable feedback in your notes file and upload it to your GitHub repository once finished and reference it in your learning log for this week. 
Additionally, do not hesitate to take notes about the research findings of others. Perhaps there is some nice/interesting information that you can include in your final report. But make sure to check the sources/references of research findings of peers to avoid mistakes and misunderstandings.

## 4) Read Nielson’s paper

You can find the paper by clicking [this link]( https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/using-machine-learning-to-predict-future-tv-ratings.pdf) . 

## 5) Work on the assignment

During the last DataLab, you had a chance to visit the office of Banijay and ask them questions about companies’ ethical behavior. So now you are advised to use the rest of the time (before the guest lecture) to work on your ethics paper and write about companies ethical practices ( make sure to check [the requirements for ethics part](https://adsai.buas.nl/Project%20Requirements/DataGovernanceRequirements.html) of your final assignment)

## 3) Workshop: Feedback (10:00-16:00)
