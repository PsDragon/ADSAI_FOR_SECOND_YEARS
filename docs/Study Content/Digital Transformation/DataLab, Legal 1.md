### 3. Debate

During the DataLab you will be divided into the groups to prepare for the debate. Together with your groupmates you will develop for and against arguments and plan how to deliver your arguments for the topic of the debate.
The groups for the debate will be selected randomly and will  present their prepared for and against arguments: one group will present their “for” arguments and another their “against” arguments. The rest of the students at the end will vote to choose who is the winner of the debate.

Instructor: Rene van der Weert

After you finish building the weather station, try to develop a plan for how you, as a team, can effectively distribute the weather stations across the neighbourhood of Brabantpark. The objective is to find inhabitants willing to take care of a weather station. As a result, there needs to be some kind of 'loan for use' agreement between BUAS and the person volunteering to take care of a weather station. You can find a template of a Dutch 'loan to use' agreement, [here](../../Study%20Content/Digital%20Transformation/loanforuseagreement_template.docx).

__Tips:__

- Determine your target group (i.e. inhabitants of Brabantpark) (Resource: [Demographics of Brabantpark](https://breda.incijfers.nl/dashboard/buurt--en-wijkdata)).
- Develop an effective communication strategy for your target group (Resource: [Communicating Across Cultures](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/communicating-across-cultures-2/the-skill-of-communicating-across-cultures?autoplay=true&u=36359204)).
- Set up a 'Loan for use' agreement for your target group (Resource: [Duidelijke juridische taal](https://directduidelijk.gebruikercentraal.nl/terugkijken-webinars/duidelijke-juridische-taal/)).
- Develop, and plan an event where you distribute the weather stations to your target group.
