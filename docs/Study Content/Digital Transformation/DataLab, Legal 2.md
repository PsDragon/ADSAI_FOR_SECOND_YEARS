### 1. Introduction

During today's DataLab each student will have a personal 30 minutes learning log feedback session with the lecturers. For this session, make sure to fill in your learning log and worklog. Prior to the DataLab, you will receive information from your lecturer regarding your timeslot for the feedback session.
We begin  DataLab with our traditional Q&A session and Standup. At the end of the day from 16:00 till 17:00 you will be able to ask questions regarding the creative brief during the Q&A.

During the time scheduled for working on the assignment, you are free to ask the lecturers for feedback.
