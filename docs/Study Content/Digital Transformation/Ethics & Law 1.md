### 1. Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field that leads to enormous new business opportunities. The growth of AI and its broad application has great economic benefits, however also results in serious societal implications.   Therefore questions of ethics are becoming vital, as AI systems might be negatively biased that can negatively impact our lives Thus different concepts and frameworks need to be taken into consideration while developing AI.
During the first independent study day, you will get insights into DEDA Framework, learn about Ethical Decision Making and prepare for the Socratics debate that will be held during tomorrowâ€™s Data Lab.
If you have questions regarding the study material, you can send us an email or attend the Q&A session at the end of each self-study day. During the Q&A session, we will extensively discuss the independent study material. For details on availability see Project Brief.
