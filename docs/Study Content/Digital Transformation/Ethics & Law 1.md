### 1. Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field that leads to enormous new business opportunities. The growth of AI and its broad application has great economic benefits, however also results in serious societal implications.   Therefore questions of ethics are becoming vital, as AI systems might be negatively biased that can negatively impact our lives Thus different concepts and frameworks need to be taken into consideration while developing AI.
During the first independent study day, you will get insights into DEDA Framework, learn about Ethical Decision Making and prepare for the Socratics debate that will be held during tomorrow’s Data Lab.

If you have questions regarding the study material, you can send us an email or ask your questions during DataLab sessions.

### 3. DEDA framework

__3a__ What is DEDA framework?

The Data Ethics Decision Aid for researchers is focused on making the dilemma of ethical decision-making explicit. The framework helps researchers reflect and justify their data-related decisions on ethical issues concerning data. DEDA is a survey that states a series of open questions.  DEDA can be used at any time during a research project. The questions stated in the survey simply function to increase awareness of certain ethical issues and help the researcher record their decision-making process.
