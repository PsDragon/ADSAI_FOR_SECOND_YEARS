### 1. Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field that leads to enormous new business opportunities. The growth of AI and its broad application has great economic benefits, however also results in serious societal implications. Therefore questions of ethics are becoming vital, as AI systems might be negatively biased that can negatively impact our lives. Thus different concepts and frameworks need to be taken into consideration while working in AI and data science. During today’s independent study day, you will get insights into Ethics,  learn about Ethical Decision Making and will be introduced into AI ethics.

If you have questions or issues regarding the course material, please fill out the 'Ask me Anything?' [form](https://adsai.buas.nl/Contact%20Us/AskMeAnything.html). A member of our teaching staff will respond as soon as possible.

### 2. Introduction into ethics

In this section you will get familiar with the concept of ethics. We will dig into several ethics related topics such as ethics strategic benefit, ethics and business, frameworks and models for making ethical decisions.

__2.1 Definition of ethics__

According to many scientific papers, ethics can be defined as a study that is concerned about what is morally right or morally wrong. To understand better what the science of ethics actually is, let’s check the video below:

*Video 1. “What is Ethics?” by Neil Nie.*

Answer the questions below:

__2a__ How would you define “ethics”?

__2b__ What would you do in the situation with Lee? Explain your choice taking into consideration your norms, values, principles and beliefs. 

__2.2 Ethics and business__

Many people think that businesses don’t have any other responsibilities besides of making profits. However, the public expect businesses to behave responsibly, and the “responsibility” comes from the domain of ethics. According to the studies about 50% of US people boycotted companies because they behaved not in the best interest of people. Additionally, it’s important to highlight that about 90% of people, based on the study, indicated that they are ready to switch to other brands if the products/ services they produced are manufactured in a more ethical way than original products/ services of their choice (Bouwer, J. (Ed.), 2019). From everything said above it becomes clear that strategic alignment of ethical actions and values can lead to more profitable business. The implementation of ethical strategy creates a competitive advantage for a business.  

Of course, when talking about business and ethics it is also important to mention that unethical decisions of companies could have impact on human lives. Below you can find some videos that showcase examples of unethical behavior of businesses.

*Video 3. “McKinsey: The Company that Poisoned America” by Jake Tran.*

Given that fact that activities of businesses could have impact on people and ethical strategy leads to a competitive advantage for a company, it’s important to evaluate the ethical principles and norms of companies and persons working for them as well as to assess the nature of the effect of companies’ activities. This is the function of business ethics. 
The study of ethics defines three elements that are vital for ethical organizational capacity. 
Those elements are:

1.	Element 1: Ethical company

The company can be considered ethical if it incorporates policies (GDPR) and behavior towards its employees (diverse team, transparent, takes feedback) and external stakeholders (customers, society and etc) (Baxter, 2018).

2.	Element 2: Ethical Process & Tools

The process can be considered to be an ethical if ethics is in cooperated in the development processes.

3.	Element 3: Ethical people (Employees and clients)

This element is focused on ethical behavior of professionals/clients towards their customers, owners, society, environment, suppliers as well on awareness about ethics, morals and acting as responsible professionals. 

### 3. AI Ethics

Due to the increasing impact, AI has on our society, the necessity to incorporate ethics within AI raises rapidly. Questions of values and norms become more vital since they can have negative biases which are almost not traceable but have an influence on our lives. Therefore, every AI professional must be aware about ethical - decision making and different policies and norms associated with ethics with data science and AI.
In this part of the independent study day, we will go into the definition of AI ethics, ethical decision – making and practical development of AI that is aligned with ethics.

### 4. DataLab preparation (Week 2, DataLab 1)

For your final assignment, you need to provide proof and evidence that the company (your client) demonstrates ethical practices. Therefore, we are asking you to conduct research into the company (Banijay) and collect evidence in terms of ethical behavior. You can use Linkedin to check employees in terms of diversity and check the website of Banijay in terms of different policies. 
Additionally, please, prepare questions for Banijay about related to companies' ethical practices. You will have a chance to ask all your questions during the visit on Wednesday during the DataLab.

__Please make sure to upload your question and conducted research to GitHub.__
