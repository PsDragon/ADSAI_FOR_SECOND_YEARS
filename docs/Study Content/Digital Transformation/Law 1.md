### 1. Introduction

Welcome to this module on the legal and ethical aspects of data and AI development and use. In this module, you will be introduced to the most relevant and important issues currently affecting how the AI industry in the EU – and international organisations working with EU companies – carries out research and development. This module is set out in three parts, corresponding with the three scheduled self-directed study days, guiding you through the learning content, and helping you to check your understanding of the information.

*The aims of this module are:*

- Explaining the legislative or law-making process in the EU, and current EU legislation that affects the process of AI development and use.

- Explaining the EU’s approach to AI and the reasons for the approach.

- Examining the current EU legislation and rules concerning development and use of AI.

-	Examining the potential legislation that will directly impact how AI development and use will be regulated in the EU.

-	Analysing the framework put into place by the European Commission for the industry to use in promoting and encouraging the ethical development and use of AI.

-	Identifying the persons and organisations responsible for ensuring that the rules and requirements are enforced, and who provide guidance and information to the EU AI industry.

*At the end of the module, you should be able to:*

- Describe the process of law-making in the EU.

-	Identify the legislation and rules put in place for AI in the EU and understand their function and purpose.

-	Recall the most important of these rules and principles to bear in mind when engaged in an AI system development process.

-	Identify the available methods to self-assess for legal and ethical compliance in developing AI systems.

-	Integrate these self-assessment methods with ongoing AI system development processes, and identify issues to resolve, or seek appropriate expert or official guidance for if necessary.

-	Identify the available resources for information, advice, guidance, and best practices for AI system development and use.
