## __Legal & Ethics (1): Rotterdam case: welfare fraud. Introduction to DEDA Framework.__

### 1. Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field that leads to enormous new business opportunities. The growth of AI and its broad application has great economic benefits, however also results in serious societal implications.   Therefore questions of ethics and legal are becoming vital, as AI systems might be negatively biased that can negatively impact our lives. Thus different concepts and frameworks need to be taken into consideration while developing AI.

During the first independent study day, you will get insights into DEDA Framework and read about Rotterdams welfare fraud case. 

### 2. Rotterdam welfare benefits case

The Rotterdam welfare benefits case is an excellent example of how the algorithms are used in welfare within the public sector.... __And how important it is to ensure greater transparency and accountability in using algorithms so the welfare system does not perpetuate biases and discrimination.__

To learn more about The Rotterdam welfare benefits case please read the two articles mentioned below and answer the listed questions and upload your answers to GitHub. You will be discussing these articles on Wednesday during the DataLab.

1. [“Inside the Suspicion Machine” by (WIRED, March 2023)](https://www.wired.com/story/welfare-state-algorithms/)

__2.1a__ What process was the Gemeente Rotterdam attempting to improve by using the ML algorithm created by Accenture?

__2.1b__ What eventually went wrong and what was the harm caused? How did this come to light?

__2.1c__ How do you think the entire product created by Accenture was supposed to work? 

__2.1d__ What may have been flaws/errors/bad practices in the use of the ML algorithm? Did the Gemeente Rotterdam use it as it was supposed to?

__2.1e__	Where, in this whole process, should the humans have “been in the loop”?

__2.1f__	Do you think this is a process that can be safely handled by a ML algorithm?

__2.1g__	What do you think about 

i) the role/responsibility of Accenture (who was hired to create the ML algorithm), and ii) the role/responsibility of Gemeente Rotterdam in using the ML algorithm?


2. [“Suspicion Machine Methodology” by (Lighthouse Reports, 2023)](https://www.lighthousereports.com/suspicion-machines-methodology/)

__2.2a__ What reactions do you have to the approach taken by the Lighthouse Reports team in their experiment, in trying to understand what went wrong with the use of the Gemeente Rotterdam ML algorithm? Give your reactions to:

•	Development and design

•	Preparing and generating data

•	Testing parity

•	Training the ML

__2.2b__ Having read this article and reviewed the experiment, do you have a better understanding of “fairness/unbiasedness by design” and creating the framework for it? Would you have approached this experiment differently? Yes/No, and why?

__2.2c__ What do you think of the validity of the experiment?

__2.2d__ How does reviewing this experiment help you in approaching the projects you are working on for this course, and what will you do differently from now on?

### 3. DEDA framework

The Data Ethics Decision Aid (DEDA) is being widely used within the public sector and focused on making the dilemma of ethical decision-making explicit. The framework helps researchers reflect and justify their data-related decisions on ethical issues concerning data. DEDA is a survey that states a series of open questions.  DEDA can be used at any time during a research project. The questions stated in the survey simply function to increase awareness of certain ethical issues and help the researcher record their decision-making process.

__3b__ Answer questions related to DEDA.
1. What are the steps of DEDA framework?
2. What is the aim of using such framework?
