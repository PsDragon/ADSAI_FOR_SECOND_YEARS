### 2. Introduction into professional writing and APA

All AI and Data professionals typically have a wide range of skills related to writing, editing, and communication. These skills help professionals to prepare clear, well-written reports and documents. Therefore it is important to develop professional writing skills which involve the ability to understand technical language as well as being able to express that knowledge in a clear, concise, and coherent manner. Additionally writing skills important for AI and Data professionals contain formatting, referencing, and writing using bias-free language. 
Before we begin acquiring new skills, it's important to highlight that during today's independent study day, we will focus on APA. However, there are a lot of different styles which format the information differently. At the Breda University of Applied Science, there is a general rule to use APA but you might face other styles while working in the industry.
