### 1. Introduction

Welcome to this course on the legal and ethical aspects of data and AI development and use. Today, you will be  understand the link between ethics and legal andd wll be introduced to The Proposed Artificial Intelligence Act and ALTAI Framework. 
All the knowledge and skills acquired today will help you to prepare for your final assignment.

### 2. Connection between legal and ethics in AI field 

The connection between legal and ethics is especially important in the field of artificial intelligence, as AI technology has the potential to impact society in significant ways.

From a legal perspective, there are a number of regulations and laws that govern the development and use of AI systems, such as data protection laws, anti-discrimination laws, and liability laws. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)(that you learned during block B) sets out requirements for how personal data can be collected, processed, and used, including data used for training AI systems.

However, while laws and regulations can provide important guidance for AI development, they are often slow to evolve and may not be able to keep pace with rapid advancements in technology. This is where ethical considerations become especially important. Ethical principles can help guide the development of AI in a way that is responsible, inclusive, and beneficial for society.

Ethical considerations in AI may include issues such as transparency and explainability of AI systems, fairness and non-discrimination, privacy and data protection, and the potential impact of AI on employment and social inequality. By taking these ethical considerations into account, developers and users of AI can help ensure that the technology is developed and used in a way that aligns with social values and promotes the greater good.

Overall, the connection between legal and ethical principles in the AI field is critical for ensuring that AI is developed and used in a responsible and beneficial way for society.

The video below explains the connection between ethics and legal in more details.

### 2. The Proposed Artificial Intelligence Act

In April this year, the European Commission unveiled the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act). At the time of writing, the proposed AI Act is going through the approval process by all 27 EU member states. When approved, it will be the first legislative and governance framework to comprehensively address the creation, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence systems in the EU. A fundamental aspect of this framework is data protection and privacy, among other human rights recognised in the EU. Similar to the GDPR, it is intended for this proposed legislation to have extra-territorial effect. It is anticipated that it will come in to force sometime in 2022/3.
The basis of the AI Act is the EU’s underlying notion that developing trustworthy technologies will benefit the global acceptance of AI in Europe. What is important for the European Commission is building trust, and fundamental to this is requiring the appropriate protection of people’s fundamental rights and promoting safety. This goal of trust-building can be attained by drawing boundaries around the why and how of developing and using AI systems. The challenge here is then ensuring that these boundaries are not so onerous that they hinder the creation of AI solutions. How does the AI Act attempt to manage this difficult balancing act between regulation and competitive innovation? The drafters of the proposed AI Act have tried to find a middle way by using an approach that has a scale of regulation that is attuned to the level of risk of an AI system:

-	where it concerns what are considered unacceptable uses of AI, these are banned outright;

-	where it concerns uses that are important but carry a high risk, these are regulated stringently;

-	where it concerns uses that have a limited risk or no obvious risk; it encourages the use of industry codes of conduct.

The message that the EU is sending is essentially that it champion and enforce AI that is trustworthy, and that it will pursue an agenda of “responsible competition” in terms of its AI goals globally. Many organisations within the EU, and even those outside the EU, especially those from countries that have economic and research links with EU states, are studying these proposed rules carefully, and are preparing to comply with them.

### 3. Putting Rules and Principles into Practice in Developing Trustworthy AI

Ahead of the AI Act coming into force and as a means to help AI developers comply with the proposed rules and the goals of trustworthy AI for the EU, an Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI) was developed by the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence established by the European Commission. This is a resource to help developers and users of AI systems assess whether the systems that are being created, used, or procured comply with the EU’s seven requirements of Trustworthy AI, as follows:

-	Human Agency and Oversight

-	Technical Robustness and Safety

-	Privacy and Data Governance

-	Transparency

-	Diversity, Non-discrimination, and Fairness

-	Societal and Environmental Well-being

-	Accountability
