# __Use-cases: Legal & Ethics__

In **today's data lab**, we will work on Legal & Ethics use cases. Use-case 1 (Topic: Check List for ethical & legal decision making), Use-case 2 (Topic: Explanation of elements within the checklist for ethical & legal decision making) and Use-case 3 (Topic: Evidencing of ethical-decision making) are related to the independent study material of Week 1. For the success of your assignment you need to complete Use-cases 2 in week 4 of Block D. The Use - case 1 can be partially completed during week 3, however, some elements within Use-case 1, need to be worked on throughout the duration of your project.
Use - case 3 can only be finalised after finishing all other tasks for your project for gemeente Breda. 

### Use-cases: 

While data is bringing various benefits to different companies and businesses, it also presents unique ethical and legal challenges. Doing ethics and legal right is not just a moral responsibility: it's obligatory for every business. Therefore, it’s crucial to have ethical and legal knowledge when working in the field of data science and applying this knowledge in the context of each project.
