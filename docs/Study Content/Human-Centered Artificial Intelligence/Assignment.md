# Final Assignment: Application Prototype

Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) is assessed by a prototype of the application of the computer vision AI you envision. During the HCAI modules, we will cover the fundamentals of
human-computer interaction with respect to AI; machine/deep learning in particular. You will create a wireframe prototype using Adobe XD to host a client demo to present your application design.

## Pre-requisites
By the time we start exploring HCAI you should have:
1. created a (conceptual) computer vision algoritms (what it will do: the core of you application);
2. a dataset of pictures for your algorithm (for prototyping);
3. Adobe XD: you should all have [the Creative Cloud](https://edubuas.sharepoint.com/sites/Pre-studyportal/SitePages/Art.aspx) package where it was included in. If not, follow the link above and the instructions and [get it with a discount using your BUas mail](https://www.surfspot.nl/).


## Prototyping
The prototype will be a demonstration of an application in which the computer vision algoritm is used a fundamental feature. The prototype should have a full user experience, meaning from start to finish, which is meaningful for the application. The prototype will undergo several the testing cycles during the datalab; as specified in the course material. Both the prototype and HCAI design doc should refelect this testing cycle and the application of the design techniques taught during the course. 


## Deliverable
The deliverable consists of a online product demo presented by the student to the client (lecturers). The presentation can be done in person or online but the demo is ran online in Microsoft Teams and is recorded (Evidence is collected automatically). The student is also expected to deliver his HCAI Design Document and the project files of his wireframe prototype.


The HCAI design document, project files of your prototype, and a link or executable of the prototype are to be uploaded to Github and linked to in your Learning Log no later than 5pm on last data lab day.

## Assessment Criteria
See the self-assessment in Microsoft Teams for the assessment criteria.
