# Final Assignment: Application Prototype

Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) is assessed by a prototype of the application of the computer vision AI you envision. During the HCAI modules, we will cover the fundamentals of
human-computer interaction with respect to AI; machine/deep learning in particular. You will create a wireframe prototype using Adobe XD to host a client demo to present your application design.

## Pre-requisites
By the time we start exploring HCAI you should have:
1. created a (conceptual) computer vision algoritms (what it will do: the core of you application);
2. a dataset of pictures for your algorithm (for prototyping);
3. Adobe XD: you should all have [the Creative Cloud](https://edubuas.sharepoint.com/sites/Pre-studyportal/SitePages/Art.aspx) package where it was included in. If not, follow the link above and the instructions and [get it with a discount using your BUas mail](https://www.surfspot.nl/).


## Prototyping
The prototype will be a demonstration of an application in which the computer vision algoritm is used a fundamental feature. The prototype should have a full user experience, meaning from start to finish, which is meaningful for the application. The prototype will undergo several the testing cycles during the datalab; as specified in the course material. Both the prototype and HCAI design doc should refelect this testing cycle and the application of the design techniques taught during the course.


## Deliverable
The deliverable consists of a online product demo presented by the student to the client (lecturers). The presentation can be done in person or online but the demo is ran online in Microsoft Teams and is recorded (Evidence is collected automatically). The student is also expected to deliver his HCAI Design Document and the project files of his wireframe prototype.


The HCAI design document, project files of your prototype, and a link or executable of the prototype are to be uploaded to Github and linked to in your Learning Log no later than 5pm on last data lab day.

## Assessment Criteria
**Formative Assessment:** On the datalab days, you are asked to informally present their ideas and work to the lectur-ers in order to receive feedback and potential redirections: this will **represent the involvement of the stakeholders.**

**Summative Assessment:** In week 8 the student will host a live demo (online or offline) of the wireframe prototype created of the app where the lecturer will act as the client to which the app is demonstrated to.  The demo should take 10 minutes (max) after which thereâ€™s a round of questions from the client which takes 10 minutes (max).
Furthermore, the quality of the wireframe will be assessed subjectively since both measures are conventially assessed subjectively in the industry, making this method more robust and ecologically valid. These supplementary conditions for the assessment of the quality of the wireframe will apply from the 'good' condition onwards. The quali-ty of the wireframe is defined by the user experience and the added value created by the application, where the user experience and value are defined by the 10 heuristics discussed in the literature. [See the following link for an abbreviated article by the author Don Norman](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

You will have to supplement your design decisions with arguments using basic design principles of user-experience design upon client inquiry and in the HCAI design document.  See the self-assessment in Section 8 for the assess-ment criteria.
