# Final Assignment: Application Prototype

Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) is assessed by a prototype of the application of the computer vision AI you envision. During the HCAI modules, we will cover the fundamentals of human-centered artificial Intelligence. You will create a wireframe prototype using Proto.io (a prototyping software which specializes in wireframes) to host a client demo to present your application design.

## Pre-requisites
By the time we start exploring HCAI you should have:
1. Project proposal high-level design & AI Canvas
2. a Proof-of-Concept (at least conceptual) of computer vision algoritms (what it will do: the core of you application);
3. the dataset of pictures for your algorithm (for prototyping);
4. Proto.io: you should all download [Proto.io](www.Proto.io) and get the free trail to finish this assignment. There are many alternatives out there which you are also free to use  such as:
- [Adobe XD](https://helpx.adobe.com/xd/get-started.html): paid but very good.
- [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com/): free and more functionality but a bit more advanced.
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/): old-school wireframe software, simple and best for desktop/machine applications. Trial and then paid.
- [Fugna](https://www.figma.com/wireframe-tool/): offers a wireframe tool and is a great platform for designing, visualisation and collaboration in general.

There are many program's out there, they come and go quite fast so therefore it useful to investigate which one fits your type of application best.


## Prototyping
The prototype will be a demonstration of an application in which the computer vision algoritm is used a fundamental feature. The prototype should have a full user experience, meaning from start to finish, which is meaningful for the application. The prototype will undergo several the testing cycles during the datalab; as specified in the course material. Both the prototype and HCAI design doc should refelect this testing cycle and the application of the design techniques taught during the course.


## Deliverable
The deliverable consists of a online product demo presented by the student to the client (your mentor). The presentation can be done in person or online but the demo is ran online in Microsoft Teams and is recorded (Evidence is collected automatically). The student is also expected to deliver his HCAI Design Document and the project files of his wireframe prototype.


The HCAI design document, project files of your prototype, and a link or executable of the prototype are to be uploaded to Github and linked to in your Learning Log no later than 5pm on last data lab day.

## Assessment Criteria
The central ILO of HCAI is 5.0 Human Centered AI: The student is able to design and develop a prototype of an application which embeds their own analyses and algorithms. Which in this project context is shaped as assessment criteria 5.1: The student is able to develop a wireframe prototype for an application embedding a novel algorithm using various design techniques, explicitly involving stakeholders in the process. The assessment is done as follows:

**Formative Assessment:** On the datalab days, you are asked to informally present their ideas and work to your mentor in order to receive feedback and potential redirections: this will **represent the involvement of the stakeholders.**

**Summative Assessment: Wireframe**
Your application design is to be showcased using a wireframe prototype to be handed in using GitHub. The quality of the wireframe will be assessed subjectively since both measures are conventially assessed subjectively in the industry, making this method more robust and ecologically valid. These supplementary conditions for the assessment of the quality of the wireframe will apply from the 'good' condition onwards. The quality of the wireframe is defined by the user experience and the added value created by the application, where the user experience and value are defined by the 10 heuristics discussed in the literature. [See the following link for an abbreviated article by the author Don Norman](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

You will have to supplement your design decisions with arguments using basic design principles of user-experience design in the project proposal itself and upon client inquiry during the final presentation. You can also refer to you notes; part of you Microsoft Team Assignment files. See the self-assessment in Section 8 for the assess-ment criteria.

**Summative Assessment: Project Proposal Presentation** Finally, the student will give a presentation of his application design using Project Proposal Presention. The presentation will include a live demo (online or offline) of the wireframe prototype created of the app where the mentor will act as the client to which the app is demonstrated to. You can let your client interact with your wireframe or operate it yourself. The demo should take 10 minutes (max) after which thereâ€™s a round of questions from the client which takes 10 minutes (max). You will hand-in the final Project Proposal Presentation powerpoint file using the Microsoft Team Assignment.

**Mapping to Deliverables**
See the self-assessment rubric in your Microsoft Teams Assignment for a detailled description of the assessment criteria for ILO 5.1. Below you can find a proposal of which deliverable to use to evidence for which rubric:
[] Wireframe Prototype Deliverable: ILO 5.1 (Poor, Sufficient, Good, Excellent)
[] Learning Log: ILO 5.1 (Insufficient, Good)
[] Project Proposal Powerpoint: ILO 5.1 (Sufficient, Good, Excellent)
