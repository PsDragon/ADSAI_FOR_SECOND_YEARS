# Datalab 13: Risk-Assessment of Disruptive Technologies
Yesterday, you create essentially the start of a high-level design for your application. Today, we'll review that with our peers and apply the GDPR framework on it to see where we might run into problems and need to iterate on our design. But, before we look at the GDPR, we're going to dicuss disruptive technologies! Also, we'll have lunch at 12:00.


## 0) Learning Objectives:
After this module you'll:
1. be able to identify disruptive technologies and the different stages thereof;
2. create and justify a high-level design for an application;
3. apply the GDPR framework to a high-level design;
4. iterate on your high-level design based on legal constraints.

Table of contents:
1. High-level Design: 1.5 hours
2. Disruptive Technology: 1.5 hours
3. Lunch: 1 hour
4. GDPR Application: 4 hours


## Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask us in the Q&A in Datalab!

Tip: Note down any important questions you might have!

Good luck!

## 1) High-level Design
Discuss your designs with your peers and collect their feedback. Create a notes section in your design document and note down any relevant feedback for or against any of your problems or solutions (and elements thereof). Take turns and go through the following steps:
1. explain your problems;
2. explain your possible solutions (the divergent ones);
3. explain your choses solution (the convergent one);
4. reiterate with a plan based on the feedback given by your peers.

## 2) Introduction to Disruptive Technologies
Covered by a interactive lecture where we'll present you with the different stages of disruptive technologies and some examples we'll explore together!

You can find [the slides here](www.google.com)!

## 3) Workshop on the GDPR
You already learned about the General Data Protection Regulation framework of the European Union ofcourse. That was a lot of documentation back then, here we just do a summary video instead and then we'll walk through a checklist and note down where we don't comply or need to take some form of action or desion decision regarding our app. That's how we do it in the real-world; we apply it to create something. Watch the video (or not if you remember everthing well enough):

1. Create a *Microsoft Word* document and *save it GitHub*!
2. Walkthrough the GDPR checklist and note where you are not complying to a given Data Protection Regulation, also note down it's number and how you are not complying:
Use [the following tool](https://gdpr.eu/checklist/) to do this!
3. For every Data Protection Regulation you are not complying with: note down the protections and protocols you need to put in place to ensure complaince.
4. Integrate these in your design: Add all these protections and protocols to your design document!


## 4) In-Class Discussion
At 16:30, there's a class meeting where we'll discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

## Up Next!
Tomorrow, we will cover interaction design more deeply!
