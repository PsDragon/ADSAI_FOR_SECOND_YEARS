# Datalab 13: Risk-Assessment of Disruptive Technologies
Yesterday, you essentially the started making the high-level design of your application. Today, you'll review your design with your peers and apply the GDPR framework on it to see where we might run into problems and identify where we need to iterate on our design. But, before we look at the GDPR, we're going to dicuss disruptive technologies!


## 0) Learning Objectives:
After this module you'll:
1. be able to identify disruptive technologies and the different stages thereof;
2. create and justify a high-level design for an application;
3. apply the GDPR framework to a high-level design;
4. iterate on your high-level design based on legal constraints.

Table of contents:
0. Stand-up & Q&A: 0.5 hours
1. Q&A
2. High-level Design Review: 1 hours
3. Disruptive Technology: 1.5 hours
4. Lunch: 1 hour - 12:00
5. GDPR Application: 4 hours


## Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask us in the Q&A in Datalab!

Tip: Note down any important questions you might have!

Good luck!

## 0) Stand-up
We start by hosting a stand-up. Form groups of ~ 5 and run on-another through the following points:
- What progress have you made up since last datalab?
- What progress do you anticipate to make today?
- What impediments are you facing or expecting?
- With what could you use help or support?

**Open your worklog and plan your day informed by the stand-up and today's schedule**

## 1) Q & A
We start by briefly reflecting on what we learned about interaction and inferace design. Do you have any questions? Now is the time to ask them!

## 2) High-level Design Review
**Open your HCAI Design Document.**

Discuss your designs with your peers and collect their feedback. Create a notes section in your design document and note down any relevant feedback for or against any of your problems or solutions (and elements thereof). Take turns and go through the following steps:
1. explain your problems;
2. explain your possible solutions (the divergent ones);
3. explain your chosen solution (the convergent one);
4. reiterate with a plan based on the feedback given by your peers.

**Save your HCAI Design Document to GitHub.**


## 3) Introduction to Disruptive Technologies
Covered by a interactive lecture where we'll present you with the different stages of disruptive technologies and some examples we'll explore together!

You can find [the slides here](www.google.com )!

### Let's apply our knowledge!
**Open your HCAI Design Document.**

1. Identify and write down potential disruptive technology risk for your chosen solution in the form of a problem-statement with any required background information;
2. Discuss the potential disruptive technology risks with two peers and record their feedback;
3. Address each potential disruptive technology risk by creating a short, written solution to the problem statement in 100 words or less. In some cases  you might not be able to come up with a solution for a given problem, or a problem might not be solveable at all. In this case: clearly explain why you might not be able to come up with a solution for a given problem in 100 words or less.

**Save your HCAI Design Document to GitHub.**

## 4) Workshop on the GDPR
You already learned about the General Data Protection Regulation framework of the European Union ofcourse. That was a lot of documentation back then. Here we just do a summary video instead and then we'll walk through a checklist and note down where we don't comply or need to take some form of action or design decision regarding our app. That's how we do it in the real-world; we concretely apply it to create something. Watch the video (or not if you remember everthing well enough):

1. Create a section in your HCAI Design Document and call it *GDPR Complaince* and *save it GitHub*!
2. Walkthrough the GDPR checklist and note where you are not complying to a given Data Protection Regulation, also note down it's number and how you are not complying:
Use [the following tool](https://gdpr.eu/checklist/) to do this!
3. For every Data Protection Regulation you are not complying with: note down the protections and protocols you need to put in place to ensure complaince.
4. Integrate these in your design: Add all these protections and protocols to your design document!

**Save your HCAI Design Document to GitHub.**

## 5) In-Class Discussion
At 16:30, there's a class meeting where we'll discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

## Up Next!
Tomorrow, we will cover interaction design more deeply!
