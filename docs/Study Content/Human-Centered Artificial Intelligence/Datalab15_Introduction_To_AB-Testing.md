Yesterday we made a deployable prototype of our vertical slice for user testing. Today, we'll have a lecture on A/B-testing after which we're going to we're going to test it with our peers. If we have time left, we'll spend it by iterating on our wireframe prototype based on the collected feedback!

## 0) Learning Objectives:
After this module you'll:
1. be able to design and run A/B-tests;

Table of contents:
0. Stand-up: 0.5 hours
1. Q&A: .5 hours
2. A/B Testing Lecture: 1 hour
3. A/B Testing on deployed prototype: X hours
4.

## Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask us if you can't figure it out together!

Good luck!
