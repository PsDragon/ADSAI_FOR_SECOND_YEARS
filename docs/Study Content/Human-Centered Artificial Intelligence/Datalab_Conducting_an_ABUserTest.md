# Datalab: Introduction to A/B-Testing
During the self-study days we've designed an A/B test which we could use to compare our 2 different wireframe prototypes. So, today we're going to conduct our A/B-test in class and then we're going to do a statistical test to see whether our improved version is a significant improvement! If we have time left, we'll spend it by iterating on our wireframe prototype based on the collected feedback!

## Learning Objectives:
After this module, you'll:
1. be able to design and run A/B tests;
2. analyse the data from an A/B test.

Table of contents:
0. Stand-up: 0.5 hours
1. A/B Testing on deployed prototype: 4 hours
2. Data Analysis: 1-2 hours
4. Iterate on Wireframe Prototype: Remainder of the day

## Questions?

If you have questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask a peer. Otherwise, ask your mentor or the responsible lecturer for the module: Bram Heijligers

Good luck!

## 0) Stand-up
We start by hosting a stand-up. Form groups of ~ 5 and run on-another through the following points:
- What progress have you made up since last datalab?
- What progress do you anticipate to make today?
- What impediments are you facing or expecting?
- With what could you use help or support?

**Open your worklog and plan your day informed by the stand-up and today's schedule**


## 1) A/B Testing on deployed prototype
Yesterday you made the version of your vertical slice as you envisioned it. But now, we're going to create a second version of you vertical slice which is slightly different then the one you created yesterday. First test your prototype with a classmate and identify points of improvement for you veritical slice to subject to A/B-testing, implement that change in the vertical slice of you wireframe prototype and deploy that version as well for user testing.

If you don't know what to change, ask the lecturers to look together with you for anything which might serve as a possible improvement. Then, run through the steps above.

**Done with you new deployed version for user testing? Open your HCAI design document and create a section called 'A/B Test Datalab 15'. Create a bullet point section for logging all feedback point!**

Let several of your classmates; or passer-by's (anyone you fancy apart from the lecturers) test your vertical slice and note along the way what/if different interactions between occur. Every other intersting feedback point should be noted too but in a seperate bullet point list called: "Non A/B-test feedback:". This is the crucial part of user testing because you will need to know what might work and what might not work in order to iterate on your design: make the best possible application.

**Save your HCAI design document to Github and note what your did; and your evidence, in your work- and learning-log**


## 2) Data Analysis
1. Download [the following notebook]() and make sure you have the required packages installed.
2. next steps...

## 3) Iterate on Wireframe Prototype
Now, based on the feedback you collected today; start improving on your design in your HCAI design document. If you have time left, you can try to immediately implement these design changes into you wireframe prototype!

## 4) In-Class Discussion
At 16:30, there's a meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

## Up Next!
Tomorrow, we make any last changes we might want to make and finalize our Project Proposal Presentation!
