# Datalab: Risk-Assessment of Disruptive Technologies
Yesterday, you essentially started making the high-level design of your application. Today, you'll review your design with your peers and learn how to build it into a prototype you can actually use! But, before we are going to learn how to make a prototype, we are going to discuss disruptive technologies, HCAI fundamentals, trends and how it compares to traditional human-computer interaction! It's more lectures than you're used to from us, but it will be a lot of material but also a lot of fun!


## Learning Objectives:
After this module, you'll:
1. create and justify a high-level HCAI design for an application;
2. be able to iterate on your high-level design based using peer-reviews;
3. be able to identify and adress disruptive technologies and the different stages thereof;
3. know the HCAI fundamentals & applications thereof;
5. prototyping HCAI application using wireframe software;

Table of contents:
1. Stand-up & Q&A: 0.5 hours
2. High-level Design Review: 1 hour
3. Disruptive Technology: 1.5 hours
    Lunch: 12:00 - 13:00
4. Human-Centered AI Fundamentals & Applications **Lecture**: 1.5 hours
5. Introduction to Wireframe prototyping using Proto.io: 1.5 Hours
6. In-Class Discussion: 0.5 Hours

If you have questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask a peer. Otherwise, ask your mentor or the responsible lecturer for the module: Bram Heijligers

Good luck!

## 1) Stand-up
We start by hosting a stand-up. Form groups of ~ 5 and run on-another through the following points:
- What progress have you made up since last datalab?
- What progress do you anticipate to make today?
- What impediments are you facing or expecting?
- With what could you use help or support?

**Now, open your worklog and plan the different tasks for today in there!**

### Q & A
We start by briefly reflecting on what we learned yesterday. Do you have any questions? Now is the time to ask them!

## 2) High-level Design Peer Review
**Open your HCAI Design Document**, and create a header called 'High-level Design Peer Review' followed by a numeric list to record the following excercise:

Discuss your designs with your peers and collect their feedback. Create a notes section in your design document and note down any relevant feedback for or against any of your problems or solutions (and elements thereof). Take turns and go through the following steps:
1. explain your problems;
2. explain your possible solutions (the divergent ones);
3. explain your chosen solution (the convergent one);
4. reiterate with a plan based on the feedback given by your peers.

**Save your HCAI Design Document to GitHub.**

Tip: Doing peer reviews on your design is a critical practice and something you should often do on your initiative! Be sure to record the feedback using the process above to present, record and address the feedback! It's an essential part of designing; you will forget why you did things the way you did otherwise!

## 3) Introduction to Disruptive Technologies
In this interactive lecture, we'll present you with the different stages of disruptive technologies and some examples we'll explore together using in-class discussions!

You can find [the slides here](./Assets/Distruptive technologies - Lecture.pptx)!

The lecture has been scheduled in your agenda but can also be attended by [clicking this link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MTczMDEzYjctODdiOS00MGM0LWFkMWQtMjE5NTM4MDk2ZTI4%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%220a33589b-0036-4fe8-a829-3ed0926af886%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225cef929d-ecf9-4fca-bf12-bc5ee065fc99%22%7d)!

### Let's apply our knowledge!
**Open your HCAI Design Document**, and create a header called 'Disruptive Technology Risks' followed by a numeric list to record the following excercise:

1. Identify and write down potential disruptive technology risks for your chosen solution in the form of a problem statement with any required background information;
2. Discuss the potentially disruptive technology risks with two peers and record their feedback;
3. Address each potential disruptive technology risk by creating a short, written solution to the problem statement in 100 words or less. In some cases, you might not be able to develop a solution for a given problem, or a problem might not be solvable at all. In this case: clearly explain why you might not be able to come up with a solution for a given problem in 100 words or less.

**Save your HCAI Design Document to GitHub.**

Done? Time to get some lunch and chill! Be back at 13:00 for a lecture on HCAI fundamental and differences with traditional human-computer interaction!

## 6) In-Class Discussion
At 16:30, there's a class meeting where we'll discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.
