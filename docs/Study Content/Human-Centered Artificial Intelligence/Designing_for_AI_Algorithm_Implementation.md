# Designing for AI Algorithms Implementation
Today we start with some reading on designing for the implementation of AI Algorithms. The rest of the day is mostly about working on your wireframe prototype!

## 0) Learning Objectives:
After this module you'll know how to designing for AI Algorithms implementation.

Table of contents:
1. Designing for AI Algorithms Implementation: 2 hours
2. Working on Wireframe Prototype; horizontal slice: 6 hours

**Now, open your worklog and plan your day informed by the stand-up and today's schedule**

## Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask us in the Q&A in Datalab!
