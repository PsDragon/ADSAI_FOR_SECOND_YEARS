# Wrapping-Up: Client Testing of Wireframe Prototypes
The last official self-study day of the block C. Time goes fast! Today, we're simply going to use our time to finalize design as recorded in our project proposal presentation and our wireframe prototype. There is some brief material to help you with your project proposal presentation but you can also spend your time working on other aspects of the creative brief if you have to; your call!

Table of contents:
1. Iterate on wireframe demo & work on presentation: 0 - 6 hours
2. Client presentation: 0.5 hours --> Check the schedule on Teams!
3. Module reflection: 0.5 hours --> 16:30

If you have questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask a peer. Otherwise, ask your mentor or the responsible lecturer for the module: Bram Heijligers

Good luck!


**Open your worklog and plan your day**


## 1) Project Proposal Presentation
For the final Project Proposal Presentation you will pitch your project to the client (mentor and another lecturer this year, no real client yet I'm afraid). As you recall from the creative brief (or request for proposal), you were requested to propose a computer vision application which (in ILO order):
1. Solves a problem in a valuable manner for a given user demographic (business understanding).
2. -
3. is responsible and explainable (responsible and explainable AI).
4. uses computer vision to solve your problem where your computer vision algorithm serves as a trimmed down Proof-of-Concept (Deep Learning)
5. is human-centered and incorperates an element of continious learning (HCAI).
For more information please see the assessment rubric and the [deliverables section for each component](https://adsai.buas.nl/Year1/BlockC/#project-requirements).

You really want to convice the client of the value and feasibility of your appplication. Make sure to cover all the essential features and include a demo of your full wireframe prototype but focus on the core features: which should revolve around your (conceptual) deep-learning algorithm and how it adds value. 

You'll be given 30 minutes in total but make sure that the presentation is no longer then 20 minutes! We want to have some time for questions! If you can do it in a shorter space of time, do that! The clients are busy people and you don't want to waste their time: get to the point! :D

Your presentation skills aren't graded here, you can use the presentation as an opportunity to evidence and defend the design of your entire project proposal (covering ILO 1,3,4 and 5) as a whole. So don't worry too much about making the best presentation but focus on conveying the value of your application, the design of the features and justifying your model/design decisions! **Look at the self-assessment rubric to see what is important for grading!**

### Presentation tips
*If you do want to make the presentation look great, [here's a guide which picks walkthroughs and products tours apart.](https://www.appcues.com/blog/product-tours-walkthroughs-ultimate-guide). You can find many more if you google something like 'how to do a UX walkthrough' or 'how to do a product tour'.

Want to record a demo of you wireframe prototype? Recording a walkthrough of your wireframe prototype can be easily done by setting up a microsoft teams meeting for you alone where you then share your screen and record it. It's automatically evidence then as well; good stuff! Alternatively, for Windows OS you can also use the microsoft game bar: press **Windows Key + G" and record your prototype.

**Make sure to evidence all your deliverables and complete your work- and learning-log!**
