# Wrapping-Up: Client Testing of Wireframe Prototypes
The last official self-study day of block C; time goes fast! Today, we will use our time to finalize the design as recorded in our project proposal presentation and our wireframe prototype. There is some brief material to help you with your project proposal presentation, but you can also spend your time working on other aspects of the creative brief if you have to; your call!

Table of contents:
1. Whatever you need to work on to finish your final deliverables, and specifically your project proposal presentation.



## Questions?

If you have questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask a peer. Otherwise, ask your mentor or the responsible lecturer for the module: Bram Heijligers

Good luck!


**Open your worklog and plan your day**


## 1) Project Proposal Presentation
For the Project Proposal Presentation, you will pitch your project to the client (mentor and another lecturer this year, no actual client yet, I'm afraid). As you recall from the creative brief (or RFP: Request For Proposal), you were requested to propose a computer vision application which (in ILO order):
1. Solves a problem in a valuable manner for a given user demographic (business understanding);
2. *disconnected from creative brief*
3. is responsible and explainable (responsible and explainable AI);
4. uses computer vision to solve your problem where your computer vision algorithm serves as a trimmed-down Proof-of-Concept (Deep Learning);
5. is human-centered and incorporates an element of continuous learning (HCAI) to create value for the end-user.

For more information, please see the assessment rubric and the [deliverables section for each component](https://adsai.buas.nl/Year1/BlockC/#project-requirements).

Essentially, you really want to convince the client of the value and feasibility of your application. So make sure to cover all the essential features and include a demo of your complete wireframe prototype but focus on the core features: which should revolve around your (conceptual) deep-learning algorithm and how it adds value. 

You'll be given 30 minutes in total, but make sure that the presentation is no longer than 20 minutes! We want to have some time for questions! If you can do it in a shorter time, do that! The clients are busy people, and you don't want to waste their time: get to the point! :D

Your presentation skills aren't graded here; you can use the presentation as an opportunity to evidence and defend the design of your entire project proposal (covering ILO 1,3,4 and 5) as a whole. So don't worry too much about making the best presentation but focus on conveying the value of your application, the design of the features and justifying your model/design decisions! **Look at the self-assessment rubric to see what is important for grading!**

Stuck?

Often people find it difficult to judge what to include when presenting their design; even when given such explicit constraints as in the template. Design is a bit difficult like that because in the end all components are important to create a holistic whole; a product with a coherent UX & function. However, a good rule of thumb for this is to focus on only the interaction which is directly needed to realize the value which is fundamental to the use case; or functionality of the app. 

If you still have difficulty pinning that down after using that lens; envision a good and a bad scenario for you end-user and then focus on the app functionality used in that scenario. E.g. your persona uses the app and A) all works as inteded, and B) things go wrong; but the apps helps the user recover and learns from the mistake (helped by the user).

### Presentation tips
If you want more tips on how to make the presentation look great with respect to showcasing your application design, then [here's a guide which picks walkthroughs and products tours apart instead](https://www.appcues.com/blog/product-tours-walkthroughs-ultimate-guide). You can find many more usefull tips and techniques if you google something like 'how to do a UX walkthrough' or 'how to do a product tour'.

Want to record a demo of your wireframe prototype instead? Recording a walkthrough of your wireframe prototype can be easily done by setting up a Microsoft teams meeting for you alone, where you then share your screen and record it. Of course, it's automatically evidence then as well; good stuff! Alternatively, for Windows OS you can also use the Microsoft game bar: press "Windows Key + G" and record your prototype.

**Make sure to evidence all your deliverables, finish you project proposal presentation and complete your work- and learning-log!**
