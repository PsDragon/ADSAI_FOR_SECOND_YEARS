# Wrapping-Up: Client Testing of Wireframe Prototypes
The last day of the block C. Time goes fast! Today, we're simply going to use our time to finalize our client presentation where you'll give a demo of your application! We'll have the time to employ all the design and testing techniques we learned the last two weeks as well.

## Learning Objectives:
After this module, you'll be able to demo your prototype to clients.


Table of contents:
1. Iterate on wireframe demo & work on presentation: 0 - 6 hours
2. Client presentation: 0.5 hours --> Check the schedule on Teams!
3. Module reflection: 0.5 hours --> 16:30




## Questions?

If you have questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask a peer. Otherwise, ask your mentor or the responsible lecturer for the module: Bram Heijligers

Good luck!

## 0) Stand-up
We start by hosting a stand-up. Form groups of ~ 5 and run on-another through the following points:
- What progress have you made up since last datalab?
- What progress do you anticipate to make today?
- What impediments are you facing or expecting?
- With what could you use help or support?

**Open your worklog and plan your day informed by the stand-up and today's schedule**

## 1) Q & A
We start by briefly reflecting on what we learned about how we implement an AI algorithm. Do you have any questions? Now is the time to ask them!

## 1) Iterate on Wireframe Prototype
Over the last 2 weeks you have learned an array of design & user testing techniques which enable you to create a great UX design for your application! Now, you're given free range to do any further user testing, design and subsequent implementation thereof in your wireframe prototype!
**Be aware that you have to make a client presentation to hand-in your design! So stop at 15:00 latest in order to make your client recording!

## 2) Client Presentation
Give the client a full walkthrough from start to finish of the application, make sure to cover all the essential features(in that sense it's a bit of a product tour-walkthrough hybrid) but focus on the core features: your (conceptual) deep-learning algorithm and how it adds value. Make sure that the presentation is no longer then 15 minutes! If you can do it in a shorter space of time, do that! The clients are busy people and you don't want to waste their time: get to the point! :D

Your presentation skills aren't graded here, you can use the presentation as an opportunity to evidence and defend the design of your wireframe and application as a whole. So don't worry too much about make the best presentation but focus on conveying the design of the features and justifying your design decisions! **Look at the self-assessment rubric to see what is important for grading!**

*If you do want to make the presentation look great, [here's a guide which picks walkthroughs and products tours apart.](https://www.appcues.com/blog/product-tours-walkthroughs-ultimate-guide) You can find many more if you google something like 'how to do a UX walkthrough' or 'how to do a product tour'.

Want to record your demo? Recording a walkthrough of your wireframe prototype can be easily done for Windows OS using the microsoft game bar: press **Windows Key + G" and record your prototype.
 </div>

**When you are finished, upload your prototype; project files/editor files & an interactive demo, and HCAI design doc to github and evidence it in your work- and learning-log!**


## 2) In-Class Discussion
At 16:30, there's a meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

## Up Next!
Just one more day and that was it for this block! No more school work, just chillings for at least a week! Hopefully two! Unless you have a side-job, sucks to be you! haha
