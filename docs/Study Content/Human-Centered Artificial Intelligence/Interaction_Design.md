# Interaction Design

For this module we are going to explore the fundamental of user interaction and experience design. We're going to look at several design techniques and proccesses. After that we're going to see how user interaction and experience differ when working with artificial intelligence applications!

## 0) Learning Objectives:
After this module you'll gain a basic understanding and learn how to apply:
1. Interaction Design;
2. User Experience Design;
3. Human-Centered AI principles.

Table of contents:
1. Interaction Design & User Experience Design: 3.5 hours
2. Human-Centered AI principles: 1.5 hours
3. Workshop: Applying UX, Interaction Design and HCAI on your project: 2.5 hours

## 1) Interaction Design
Interaction is all about change: by exchanging information in the form of data or energy we're creating some kind of new state in the world. I can for example gain new information in the form of data making me more aware of a given danger in a game. Or I can exchange information in the form of energy by kicking a football and thereby launching it away from me. What it essentially comes down to when you are designing for interaction is that you create some kind of change which the user can anticipate and work with: Design should be intuitive.

Like doors, they are great when they are intuitive. Like the door of our classroom. But some doors, they just don't make sense and are very frustrating...

So now that we learned why some doors are more frustrating then other, and how we should design intuitively: making interaction predictable for the user. We can dive into the topic with more depth.

## 2) Interaction Design for AI
Machine learning (ML) is the science of helping computers discover patterns and relationships in data instead of being manually programmed. It’s a powerful tool for creating personalized and dynamic experiences, and it’s already driving everything from Netflix recommendations to autonomous cars. But as more and more experiences are built with ML, it’s clear that UXers still have a lot to learn about how to make users feel in control of the technology, and not the other way round.
As was the case with the mobile revolution, and the web before that, ML will cause us to rethink, restructure, displace, and consider new possibilities for virtually every experience we build. In the Google UX community, they’ve started an effort called “human-centered machine learning” (HCML) to help focus and guide that conversation. Using this lens, we look across products to see how ML can stay grounded in human needs while solving them in unique ways only possible through ML. Google works with UXers across the company to bring them up to speed on core ML concepts, understand how to integrate ML into the UX utility belt, and ensure ML and AI are built in inclusive ways. Let's take a look at their design principles by watching the following video's:

## 3) Workshop on Designing Human-Centered AI Applications
Open your Design Document and answer the following questions in it:
1. Why does the problem your solving with you application benefits more from an AI solution then a traditional solution?
2. How would you describe the way a theoretical human “expert” might perform the task today?
3. If your human expert were to perform this task, how would you respond to them so they improved for the next time?
4. If a human were to perform this task, what assumptions would the user want them to make?

## Next up!
Coming Datalab we will reflect on Interaction Design and User Experience; with and without AI, again!

Tomorrow we will first continue to expand our knowledge by applying it a subfield: interface design!
