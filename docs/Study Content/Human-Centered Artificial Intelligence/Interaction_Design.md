# Interaction Design

For this module we are going to explore the fundamentals of user interaction and experience design. We're going to look at several design techniques and proccesses. After that we're going to see how user interaction and experience differ when working with artificial intelligence applications!

## 0) Learning Objectives:
After this module you'll gain a basic understanding and learn how to apply:
1. Interaction Design;
2. User Experience Design;
3. Prototyping HCAI application using Wireframe software

Table of contents:
1. Human-Centered AI Fundamentals & Application **Lecture**: 1.5 hours
2. Interaction Design & User Experience Design: 3.5 hours
3. Workshop: Applying UX, Interaction Design and HCAI on your project: 2.5 hours

**Now, open your worklog and plan the different tasks for today there!**

## Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask us in the Q&A in Datalab!

Good luck!

## 1) Lecture:
The kick-off has been scheduled in your calendar but can also be attended by (clicking this link)(www.venray.nl). The kick-off outlines what this module is about, how we will learn about HCAI and how we will assess your final deliverable: a wireframe prototype!

## 2) Interaction Design
Interaction is all about change: by exchanging information in the form of data or energy we're creating some kind of new state in the world. I can for example gain new information in the form of data by vision, sound or vibrations; this new information makes the user aware of something; changing the internal state of the user. Or I can exchange information in the form of energy by kicking a football and which after my interaction will interact further with the environment. What it essentially comes down to when you are designing for interaction is that you create some kind of change which the user can anticipate and understand without thinking: Design should be intuitive.

Like doors, they are great when they are intuitive. Like the door of our classroom. But some doors, they just don't make sense and are very frustrating...

So now that we learned why some doors are more frustrating then other, and how we should design intuitively: making interaction predictable for the user. We can dive into the topic with more depth.

## 3) Working on your wireframe!:

bla bla bla

## Next up!
Coming Datalab we will reflect on Interaction Design and User Experience!

Tomorrow we will first continue to expand our knowledge by applying it a subfield: interface design! We will also continue to further work out our design by creating user stories tomorrow!
