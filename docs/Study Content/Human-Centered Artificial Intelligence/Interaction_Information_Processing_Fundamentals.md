# Interaction & Information Processing Fundamentals

We start our dive into Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence with a general introduction to interaction design and information processing with regards to humans. Then, we're going to look into a couple of design techniques after which we'll apply them on our project in preperation for upcoming datalab!

## 0) Learning Objectives:
After this module you'll:
1. Understand the Extended Mind Hypothesis;
2. Understand the Network-Enabled Cognition Hypothesis;
3. Know and Apply Design Thinking;

Table of contents:
1. Interaction and Information Processing Fundamentals: 1 hours
2. Design Techniques:  1 hour
3. Workshop: 6 hours (or less if you're done early)

**Now, open your worklog and plan your day informed by the stand-up and today's schedule**

## 1) Introduction to Iteraction and Information Processing Fundamentals
To figure out how we data-driven application for humans, especially AI operated ones, we first require a deeper understanding of what it means for humans to interact and proces information. So, how do humans interact with the world and how do they proces information? The following video explains how information processing, the environment and our online environment are actually one continous proces. Information isn't created or processed simply in one place but a result of interaction between multiple entities; these can be objects interacting with object, or with phenomena or with humans. That's what the theory of the Extended Mind and Network Enabled Cognition is about! Let's dive into it and create this context from which to build from for ourselves!

## 2) Design Techniques
What is design? Essentially, designing is simply conceptualizing a method to solve a give problem. This problem can be abstract and not clearly defined; artists or craftsmen usually just want to create something and don't clearly define a problem, or more structured where a designer clearly defines a problem and the requirements for solving that problem. We're going to follow the latter method since we're working with structured data, models, ethics and regulations: we can't just go YOLO and make something and expect it to work. That will cost us a lot of time, iteration cycles and frustration; like we don't have enough of that already, so we're going to take a problem-solving approach to design. Let's dive into it!

### Design thinking
[Design thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking) is essentially a structured approach to define and solve a problem keeping requirements in mind. A lot of people who use it enjoy giving it fancy terms and using all kinds of buzzwords, like this definition of wikipedia uses:

"Design thinking is a term used to represent a set of cognitive, strategic and practical processes by which design concepts (proposals for products, buildings, machines, communications, etc.) are developed. Many of the key concepts and aspects of design thinking have been identified through studies, across different design domains, of design cognition and design activity in both laboratory and natural contexts."

It's an effective method, but essentially it's all about defining a problem and solution; some people just re-invented the wheel and wanted to give it a fancy name and terms. These complicated terms are useful for research and talking to clients or convincing collegues but usually meaningless when actually practicing it in the field. That's fine ofcourse, and it makes us feel better about ourselves when designing right? Furthermore, it resulted in great accumulation of design techniques which are tried and tested! **Do the full linkedin Learning course below and save the certificate to your github and evidence it in your learning- and worklog**

### Divergent - Convergent Processes
Let's zoom in on this proces again, let's specifically use this model to define an array of solutions and select one. That way we can present an array to our peers in datalab tomorrow (or clients/collegues) and motivate why we picked one.

Watch the videos below and then make the excercises!

## 3) Workshop
Create a digital document (Microsoft Word, and remember that you have to evidence it), call it 'HCAI Design Document - [NameOfApplication] - [StudentName]' and record the following:
1. **Define your problem!**
- What problem does your algorithm solve?
- Clearly define it in max 100 words! You can also only just use one word too; e.g. hunger. Remember, you have to explain it to your peers and lecturers tomorrow!
2. **Diverge with multiple solutions**. Come up with 3 solutions at least! You can come up with as many as you like, just make sure you have at least 3! Motivate you solution by at least answering the following questions:
- What could solve your problem?
- How is it going to solve your problem?
- Why is it feasible?
- What are the requirements for this solution to work?
3. **Converge on best solution**: by answering the following questions.
- Which solution solution do you think is best?
- Why do you think it's the best solution?
- How well do you think it solves the problem? Define this in a percentage and motivate your answer.

**Upload your document to Github!** *Also note that if you don't fill out the name slots this time, you will have to do push ups in class!*

## Next up!
Coming Datalab we will reflect on these concept again, review your designs: your problems and solutions, and give you an opportunity to ask any questions you might have.

Tomorrow in Datalab, we will also cover disruptive technologies and see how well we comply with the GDPR regulations for our chosen solution! It's more fun then it sounds, I promise!
