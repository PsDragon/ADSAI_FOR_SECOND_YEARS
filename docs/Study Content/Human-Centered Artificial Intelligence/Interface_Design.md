# Interface Design
After covering the basics of HCAI, we're going to zoom in at interface design: the means, or medium, by which users communicate with computerized devices. We're also going to look into flow theory, engagement and immersion! Finally, we're going to continue working on our wireframe prototype, specifically finishing the vertical slice of our wireframe prototype in proto.io!

## Learning Objectives:
After this module, you'll gain a basic understanding and learn how to apply:
1. Flow-Theory;
2. User Interface Design;
3. Prototyping a vertical slice with proto.io.

Table of contents:
1. Flow: 1 hour
2. User Interface Design: 1 hour
3. Prototyping: Create a vertical slice: 4 hours
4. Update learning- & worklog: 0.5 hours

**Now, open your worklog and plan the different tasks for today in there!**

## Questions?

If you have questions or issues regarding the course material, please post a message on the 'Q&A' channel in Teams. The channel will be monitored by mentors but also please help your peers if you have the answer to their question.

Good luck!



## 1) Flow
In positive psychology, [flow](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/flow-theory) is considered to a mental state in which a person is fully immersed; fully focussed; fully involved and fully enjoying a given activity. Essentially, it's a form of complete absorbtion into the activity: all that matters and all the mind is involved in is the activity and it's relevant elements. That's what it means to "be in the flow"!

## 2) User Interface Design
**An interface is essentially a means of interaction** between two objects: two stars inferfacing with each other using gravity or a person; or user, and a computer interfacing with one another using some computerized device to exchange information. A User Interface (UI) can be: 
- low-fidelity like controlling a electricity generator with some buttons; 
- medium-fidelity like a keyboard and a programming IDE where one has to literally insert and verbalize the commands;
- or high-fidelity where the user is guided through the functionality the computerized environment provides like a fancy smartphone app or virtual game! 

Note that fidelity is a measure of the quality of the interaction; and UX in extension. Visual fidelity will for most people immeditately spring to mind but it is a component; usually the most important one overall but there are many other means of interaction: 

- audio;
- haptic;
- movement; 
- etc. 

There's more ofcourse; it's related to our sense but usually smell isn't incorperated so let's not deviate and limit ourselfs to the aformentoined 4. And it's not just the type of interaction but also how interaction takes place (timing, conditions for triggering, consequent effects etc.) are equally important.
Now that we know what a User Inferface (UI) is for and howit facilitates interaction, let's dive deeper into how we can design one for our application!

## 4) Prototyping: Create a horizontal slice
Now, use the skills you learned so far to create a horizontal slice of the full application from start to finish! Make sure to include the screen(s) where you computer vision algorithm is actively used in Proto.io. So for the beer bottle scanner app, this would just be the camera and what the user can do there; which user stories are connected to using that feature?

Run through your horizontal slice, how does it feel? Make some notes on your different versions in your Block C Notes - Y1C_2022-23_ADSAI if you iterate on them; what works and what not? How do you iterate on them? Maybe you want to finalize your wireframe already as much as possible? Add audio effects if you're feeling fancy, it's a lot of fun :p


**Save your Wireframe Prototype to Github by exporting is a .zip file, name it 'HCAI_Wireframe_[NameOfApplication]_[StudentName]' (if you didn't do so already) and note what your did in your work- and learning log; and link your .zip file as evidence.**

## 5) Prepare you learning log and worklog for the feedback session tomorrow!

### Done early? 
Take a look at your project proposal presentation, which slides can you already fill-in and which do you need to update? Feel like going ahead with designing? Feel free to do so, just design the rest of your app at will and embellish it! You can also look into some of the resources offered over the last couple of days to see if you can further substantiate your design; maybe you want to include some more advance metrics like crowdsourcing or quantified self aspects? You can find link to extra information in the [HCAI Fundamentals & Applications Powerpoint](https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/ADS-AI/blob/cbea9fe9290a5512a2ed59137ff6791ec232ddcc/docs/Study%20Content/Human-Centered%20Artificial%20Intelligence/Assets/HCAI%20Fundamentals%20and%20Applications.pptx)! 
Alternatively, you could start with Monday's material or work on other parts of the creative brief!

## Datalab Preparation Checklist:
- [ ] Datalab Preparation 1: Certificate of LinkedIn Learning Course - The power of flow in interaction design from Interaction Design: Flow by Diane Cronenwett
- [ ] Datalab Preparation 2: Certificate of LinkedIn Learning Course - Introducing the interface from Interaction Design: Interface by Diane Cronenwett
- [ ] Datalab Preparation 3: Create a Horizontal slice in Proto.io

## Next up!
Coming Datalab, we will look at potential disruptive technology risks for our app and use-case. Also you'll have your feedback sessions so please be prepared!

Next Wednesday, we will user test our vertical slice prototypes by peer-reviewing them! After that we're going to do a very magical Wizzard of Oz workshop, and ofcourse it'll be an opportunity to ask any questions you might have!
