# Designing for AI Algorithms Implementation
Today we start with some reading: an article how to design for the implementation of AI Algorithms. The rest of the day is mostly about working on your wireframe prototype!

## Learning Objectives:
After this module, you'll know how to designing for AI Algorithms implementation.

Table of contents:
1. Designing for AI Algorithms Implementation: 2 hours
2. Working on Wireframe Prototype; horizontal slice: 6 hours
3. User Feedback: 1 Hours

**Now, open your worklog and plan the different tasks for today in there!**

## Questions?

If you have questions or issues regarding the course material, please post a message on the 'Q&A' channel in Teams. The channel will be monitored by mentors but also please help your peers if you have the answer to their question.

Tip: Note down any important HCAI related questions you might have! You can ask them during Datalab in person to the responsible lecturer for this module: Bram Heijligers

Good luck!



## 1) How to design for the implementation of AI Algorithms
Google features some great articles, we've read some of them before. Now, open your design document and create a note section with the header "How to design for the implementation of AI Algorithms". Then go and read [this acticle](https://design.google/library/simulating-intelligence/) and note down design principles of how you do it in general; specifically focussing on the differences with regular UX design. Then look at your project using your newly fangled design principles and adjust your UX design; and derivative components, accordingly. Make sure to document what you change.

**Upload your document to Github!**


## 2) Working on Wireframe Prototype; horizontal slice
With those changes to the design document we made our laste iterative design loop which included new design techniques. Next, we're going to implement any design changes you made in the prototype. If you're finished with that just keep working untill you consider your prototype finished!
If you are saturated or don't have enough time: there's time to work on it tomorrow as well but preferably you can use that time to test it with your peers and lecturers.



## Next up!
Coming Datalab we will reflect on designing for AI Algorithms Implementation again and give you an opportunity to ask any questions you might have.

Tomorrow, we will make client demonstration of our full design: a screen captures (video recordings) of our deployed wireframe prototypes which we'll upload to Github and hand-in for assessment!
