## 3) New project?
For this course, we already had our AI Algorithm and we just had to implement it, but if you ever need to start the proces from scratch you should take a look at the [AI guidebook provided by Google](https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook). It's really great!

## Next up!
Coming Datalab we will reflect on TOPIC again and give you an opportunity to ask any questions you might have.

Tomorrow, we will cover TOPIC!
