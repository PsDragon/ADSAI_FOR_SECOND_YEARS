# User-Centered Design for AI
When we looked into interaction design, we already covered the basics of Human-Centered AI products and experiences. Today, we're going to dive deeper into this topic and look how our deeper understanding might influence our design and implement these changes. Then, we're going to learn about horizontal prototyping and create a horizontal prototype from our current wireframe!

## Learning Objectives:
After this module, you'll understand and know how to apply the basic principles of:
1. Human-Centered Artifical Intelligence;
2. UX & AI; Adaptive interfaces;
3. UX & AI: Recommender systems
We will start by completing our course of using Adobe XD.

Table of contents:
1.
2. Human-Centered Artifical Intelligence: 1 hours
3. UX & AI; Adaptive interfaces: 1 hours
4. Recommender systems: 1 hours
5.

**Now, open your worklog and plan the different tasks for today there!**

## Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask us in the Q&A in Datalab!

Good luck!

## 1) Adobe XD: making a wireframe prototype
Now, it's time to finish getting to know how to use the Adobe XD application! Finish by doing the Linkedin Learning course below, specifically doing modules 7. Voice Interactions, and 9. Goodbye, to get the certificate. **Upload the certificate to GitHub and evidence it in the learning log!**

## 2) Human-Centered Artifical Intelligence
Google is making a lot great resources on this topic and is leading the world in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. The guy who you saw earlier talking about HCAI made a great article about it. Read the full text over [here](https://medium.com/google-design/human-centered-machine-learning-a770d10562cd)

##  3) UX & AI; Adaptive interfaces
AI; machine learning or reactive, has the ability to make our UX systems & UI interaces adaptive! This is something which bring UI and UX to a new level. This article will help you understand how they can enabled that; and where you should and shouldn't apply it.
[Read the full acticle over here](https://design.google/library/ux-ai/).

## 4) UX & AI: Recommender systems
Recommendation systems such a netflix, spotify or youtube also provide a user experience ofcourse. As you can imagine by now, designing a UX with machine- or deep-learning in mind brings about different design constraints then regular UX design. [Read the following article to gain a deeper understanding of how this works](and [read the second article over here!](https://design.google/library/designing-and-learning-teachable-machine/).

## 4) Wireframe Prototype
**Open your HCAI design document and create a section called 'User-Centered Design for AI' and note down any points which might be relevant for you design you learned today!**

Now, taking all this mind: what can you apply to your own application design? What should you iterate on? Note all this down in the bullet points you just created.

Next, start implementing these design changes in your wireframe prototype and build the full horizontal slice!
A horizontal is essential a prototype of the full version of your application: design and build in from back to front! From start-up till the exit of the application!

**Save your HCAI design document to Github and note what your did; and your evidence, in your work- and learning-log**


## 5) New project?
For this course, we already had our AI Algorithm and we just had to implement it, but if you ever need to start the proces from scratch you should take a look at the [AI guidebook provided by Google](https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook). It's really great!

## Next up!
Coming Datalab we will reflect on User-Centered Design for AI again and give you an opportunity to ask any questions you might have.

Tomorrow, we will cover designing for AI Algorithms!
