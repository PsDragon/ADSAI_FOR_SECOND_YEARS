## 1) HCAI: UX-design for AI
Last Wednesday we covered HCAI from a high-level perspective to get us all quickly going so we could quickly prototype our core design. Let's now recap and dive deeper into the field to better understand how HCAI connects everyhting we have been doing this block together!

Human-centered artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the design and development of AI systems with a primary focus on human needs, values, and well-being. This approach to AI puts people at the center of the design process, prioritizing their needs, preferences, and perspectives, and taking into account the social and ethical implications of AI. Keeping these values in mind makes sure that whatever we create is actually much more usefull and impactfull; ChatGPT creators mentoin that their key breakthrough was achieved because they always kept its usability in mind for example. 

Human-centered AI involves understanding human behavior, preferences, and decision-making processes, and incorporating this understanding into the design of AI systems; serving as an extension of our human capabilities. Therefore, it also involves ensuring that AI systems are transparent, explainable, and accountable, so that people can understand how they work, trust them, and hold them accountable for their actions. So by prioritizing human needs and values, human-centered AI has the potential to improve people's lives, enhance their decision-making capabilities, and enable them to achieve their goals faster, more efficiently, with greater efficacy; and in a safe and ethical manner. 

### Datalab Prep, Excercise 1. UX-design for AI:
Technology is progressing rapidly and within that the field of AI is in a class of its own. Therefore, it's difficult to keep up to date with the latest developments as new models and techniques enter the field, become mainstream or get outdated. Luckily, Google is making a lot great resources on this topic and is leading the world in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence; even though Google grip is slipping with rising stars such as OpenAI. The guy who you saw earlier talking about HCAI made a great article about it: 
1. [Read the full text over here](https://medium.com/google-design/human-centered-machine-learning-a770d10562cd) to reiterate the concepts and expand on your core understanding! While reading, consider how you could use the techniques and insights presented in the article to (potentially) improve on your design.  
2. In the **Block C Notes - Y1C_2022-23_ADSAI** document, write down at least one possible design iteration based on the full text. Or if your design is perfect, argue why it is using the insights and techniques presented in the article.


## 2) Recommender systems: how to teach a machine
Recommender systems are a type of artificial intelligence that is designed to provide personalized recommendations to users. These systems, usually, use machine learning algorithms and statistical models to analyze user data and behavior, in order to generate recommendations that are tailored to each individual user's preferences and interests.

There are various types of AI recommender systems, but the most common ones are:
- Content-based recommenders - which recommend items based on the similarity of their content to items that a user has previously interacted with.
- Collaborative filtering recommenders - which recommend items based on the similarity of the user's preferences to those of other users.
- Hybrid recommenders - which combine content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to generate recommendations.

AI recommender systems are widely used in e-commerce (Booking.com), social media (Instagram, TikTok), and other online platforms (Google Search) to help users discover new products, services, and content. They are also used in healthcare, education, and other domains to provide personalized recommendations to patients, students, and other users.
The effectiveness of AI recommender systems depends on the quality of the data they are trained on, the sophistication of the algorithms used, and the design of the user interface. To ensure that recommender systems are trustworthy, ethical, and effective, it is important to incorporate human-centered design principles into their development and evaluation.

Human-centered recommender systems prioritize the interests and well-being of users over the interests of businesses or advertisers; they should empower the user. Therefore, they are designed to respect users' privacy and autonomy and to give them control over their data and preferences; thereby empowering them to steer the recommender in a way which serves them best. This means that users should be able to easily understand how the system works, what data is being used, and how their preferences are being used to generate recommendations.

Another important aspect of human-centered recommender systems is that they should be transparent and explainable. Users should be able to understand how the system generates recommendations, and they should be able to easily provide feedback on the quality of the recommendations. This feedback should be used to improve the system and make it more user-centered over time.

Finally, human-centered recommender systems should be designed to promote diversity and reduce biases. They should be sensitive to cultural and individual differences, and should avoid reinforcing existing biases or discrimination. This means that the system should provide a variety of options and perspectives to users, rather than just promoting the most popular or profitable options.

### Datalab Prep: Excercise 2. Recommender Systems
Recommendation systems such a netflix, spotify or youtube also provide a user experience ofcourse. And as argued above, designing a UX with machine- or deep-learning in mind brings about different design constraints then regular; more state-machine based, UX design. 
1. [Read the following article to gain a deeper understanding of how this works](https://design.google/library/designing-and-learning-teachable-machine/) to reiterate the concepts and expand on your core understanding! While reading, consider how you could use the techniques and insights presented in the article to (potentially) improve on your design.  
2. In the **Block C Notes - Y1C_2022-23_ADSAI** document, write down at least one possible design iteration based on the full text. If your design doesn't make use of a recommendation system, consider if you could add value by adding one and explain why; adversely if it wouldn't add value then explain why it does not. Or if your design is perfect, argue why it is using the insights and techniques presented in the article.

##  3) UX & AI; Adaptive interfaces
AI; machine learning or reactive, has the ability to make our UX systems & UI interaces adaptive! This is something which bring UI and UX to a new level. Although interesting, this isn't the main focus of this module If you are interested however, you can use [this libray to delve further into the topic](https://design.google/library/ux-ai/); and where you should and shouldn't apply it.

## 4) Quality user feedback
User feedback is essential to any digital application: if the user provides some kind of input to the digital devices, then they will expect some kind of response that:
1. Their input has been registered.
2. That their input is meaningful and has some kind of effect. Or not, if it's a faulty interaction.
Here's funny demo of succesfull interaction followed by apt user feedback, followed by unsuccesfull interactions with apt user feedback:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OAQ7l33UF3E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The user needs to know what is going on with the device given some interaction he does, otherwise he is not able to anticipate what will happen if he does activity x,y or z. And if he doesn't know what will happen if he does a given activity then the design is not intuitive and the user will drop the product/application.

You can further improve user feedback by making it feel rewarding to the user: this is called juicy feedback.

### Rewarding User Feedback: Juicy Design
Juicy design refers to the idea that large amounts of sensory (usually audiovisual or tactile feedback) contribute to a positive user experience which can contribute to positive user experience and
continued and increased engagement and invoke a state of flow. Juicy design is a concept which is very popular in game design, therefore we're going to take a short expedition into the world of game design.

### Datalab Prep: Excercise 3. User Feedback
1. Consider how you could use the techniques and insights about user feedback you were just presented to improve on your design. Then in the **Block C Notes - Y1C_2022-23_ADSAI** document, write down at least one possible design iteration regarding user-feedback. Or if your user feedback is already perfect, argue why it is using the insights and techniques presented in the pressented text.

## 5) Designing for the implementation of AI Algorithms
The process concerning designing for AI algorithm implementation involves a number of steps and considerations. Although HCAI needs to consider the entirety of the process, it is really set apart by the integration, maintainance en monitoring off an algorithm once released. For this block we've essentially followed the following structure: 

1. Define the problem (business understanding): Before designing an AI algorithm, it is important to clearly define the problem you are trying to solve. This involves understanding the user needs, the data sources available, and the performance metrics that will be used to evaluate the algorithm.
2. Gather and prepare data (responsible AI): AI algorithms require high-quality data to train and test. You will need to gather and prepare data sets that are relevant to the problem you are trying to solve. This may involve cleaning, transforming, and normalizing data to ensure that it is consistent and reliable.
3. Choose the right algorithm (deep learning): There are many different AI algorithms available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. You will need to choose the algorithm that is best suited to your problem, data, and performance metrics.
4. Train and test the algorithm (deep learning and responsible AI): Once you have chosen an algorithm, you will need to train it on your data sets and test it to evaluate its performance. This may involve tweaking the algorithm parameters or trying different algorithms until you achieve the desired results. Furthemore, you also need to be able to understand the algorithm, explain it to stakeholders and ensure it is as responsible as possible; transparant, unbiased and fair.
5. Integrate the algorithm (HCAI): Once the algorithm has been trained and tested, you will need to integrate it into your system or application. This may involve developing APIs or other interfaces to allow other systems to access the algorithm.
6. Monitor and maintain the algorithm (HCAI): AI algorithms require ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure that they continue to perform well over time. You will need to monitor the algorithm's performance, update it as needed, and retrain it periodically to ensure that it remains accurate and effective.

In block D we'll bring step 5 and 6 further as we're going to deploy our algorithm/data analysis in the real-world; e.g. using an API. For now though, we'll focus on the design for it; which comes first ofcourse. To help you along with this, Google features some great articles. We've already read some of them today. 

### Datalab Prep: Excercise 4. Designing for AI Algorithm Implementation
1. Read [this acticle](https://design.google/library/simulating-intelligence/) and consider  
2. Open the **Block C Notes - Y1C_2022-23_ADSAI** document, write down at least one possible design iteration to better implement your computer vision component. 
3. Are there any other AI algorithms; e.g recommender system, which you have to implement? Write down how you would implement these, and how they would work together with other AI components specifically; does tuning/add new data for one have implications for the other?


## 4) Wireframe Prototype

### Datalab Prep: Excercise 5. Wireframe iteration.
1. **Open your wireframe prototype in proto.io. Export your project and save it to GitHub as a zipped folder named "YourNameAppHere_Baseline".** If your project is too big somehow, save it to your Microsoft Onedrive using teams or sharepoint.
2. Take a look at the previous 4 excercises and consider how you could improve you wireframe for each excercise. **Now, start making the improvememnts but only implement the design iterations for 1 excercise at a time!** Then, save your project, export your project as a zipped folder and name it:
- "YourNameAppHere_Ex1-UXAI"
- "YourNameAppHere_Ex2-Reccomder"
- "YourNameAppHere_Ex3-UXFeedback"
- "YourNameAppHere_Ex4-Algorithm"

We're doing this so we can keep track of our design iterations but more importantly, we're going to want a selection of different version of your app design to investigate which one is best in the upcoming datalab! Intuitively, you last design would be the best one, but quantifying how good a design actually is and why is rather difficult as it turns out... Humans experience is difficult quantify and is even harder to definitively explain; there are so many influencing factors!

Within this module we have looked at a pletora of design techniques and lenses to shape our application design. However there are many approach to take for an app design and many more technqiues to consider. If need more information or even need to start the proces from scratch you should take a look at the [AI guidebook provided by Google](https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook). It's really great!

## Next up!
Tomorrow will see us desiging an user-test which can statistically prove which version of an app design is the best one! It's crucial if you want to pass this course so be sure to prepare it well!
