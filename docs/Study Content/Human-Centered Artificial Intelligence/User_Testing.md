# User Testing
Today we will dive deeper into user feedback and user testing. How do we really know what works and what doesn't? This is one of the most difficult topic in UX-design and all the more within HCAI. How do we know what results from what? How do we isolate a given factor an pinpoint it as the cause for a given functionality? 

Then we are going to take our new knowledge; as well as the feedback on your design collected last datalab, and apply it to our design to create a new vertical slice for our wireframe prototype!

## Learning Objectives:
After this module, you'll be able to:
1. create rewarding user feedback;
2. create and conduct various user tests in UX;
3. create and deploy a digital vertical slice of your wireframe prototype.
4. conduct and understand a/b testing

Table of contents:
1. User Testing: 2 hours
2. A/B testing: 4 hour
3. Wireframe Iteration: 2 hours

**Now, open your worklog and plan the different tasks for today in there!**

Good luck!



## 1) User Testing
All products should include some form of user testing, whether they are digital or not, interactive or non-interactive: as a designer you generally know too much about the product and technology relating to your own project. You cannot simply pretend you don't know these things; that's not how your brain works, and therefore we perform user tests to create a ecologically valid setup to test our designs!

## 2) A/B Testing
A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two different versions of a webpage or app to determine which one performs better. The process involves randomly dividing users into two groups, with each group being shown a different version of the page. The results are then analyzed to determine which version is more effective at achieving the desired outcome, such as increasing sales or conversions.  With the A/B test you only test one variable at a time and to ensure that your sample size is large enough to achieve [statistically significant results](https://hbr.org/2016/02/a-refresher-on-statistical-significance). 


Don't worry about your sample size for now, we'll take care of that in Datalab next week. In Year 2, block A we're going to investigate how you can determine an appropriate sample size for a given statistical test.

The video below explains A/B testing in detail.

### Practical example or the key to success (an interesting read)
Booking.com is a popular online travel agency known for its extensive and successful use of A/B testing to improve its website. The company runs over 1,000 tests per day, which amounts to more than 400,000 tests per year. Booking.com's A/B testing program is considered one of the largest and most sophisticated in the industry.

One of the keys to Booking.com's success is its dedicated A/B testing team. The team consists of experienced data analysts, developers, and designers who work together to identify opportunities for optimization and run tests to validate their hypotheses. The team follows a structured approach to A/B testing, starting with clear hypotheses based on data analysis and user feedback.

Before starting a test, the team defines clear goals and [KPIs](https://www.kpi.org/kpi-basics/) to ensure that the results are meaningful and relevant to the business. They also take care to ensure that the tests are statistically valid by using appropriate sample sizes and testing durations. This helps to minimize false positives and false negatives and ensure that the results are reliable.

*Figure 1. Booking.com’s Testing Process*

Booking.com's A/B testing program is supported by sophisticated machine learning algorithms and automation tools. These tools help the team to identify patterns and trends in the test results and suggest new hypotheses for further testing. They also help to streamline the testing process by automating tasks such as test setup, data collection, and analysis.

Through its extensive use of A/B testing, Booking.com has been able to continuously optimize its website and improve its user experience. Some of the notable improvements that have resulted from A/B testing include faster page load times, more prominent [calls-to-action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_action_(marketing)), and personalized search results. Booking.com's success with A/B testing has made it a model for other businesses looking to improve their online presence and user experience.

### DataLab preparation 2: Planning for A/B testing
**open your Block C Notes - Y1C_2022-23_ADSAI document, create a section called 'Planning for A/B testing' and do the following excercises.**
1. Please summarize the steps that you need to conduct for A/B testing. 
2. Open you learning log and take a look at the feedback you collected from your peers and lecturers during Datalab this week. Write down one or more iterating options for your application design. Make sure to iterate on your user stories based on the feedback. 

3. Consider you core functionality; your computer vision algorithm, and how it's embedded in your application design. How is the user going to make operate it? Come up with several brief alternative designs and write them down in your Block C Notes file. Just changing some basic interaction or button.
3. 

### DataLab preparation 3: Setting up for A/B testing
Remember the questionnaire you were handed in block A to collect feedback on your dashboard for Data Science? We're now going to user that software again to create our own questionnaire. 
1. Let's start by getting familliar with Qualtrics by doing [the planning and designing a survey tutorial!](https://basecamp.qualtrics.com/) 
2. Create a new project on [Qualtrics](https://buas.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/MyProjectsSection)
3. Go for the first option 'Survey' under the header 'From scratch'.
4. Click on 'Get started'
5. Name it: AB-test and create the survey (don't use any template, just a blank project).



## 2) Build on Wireframe Prototype: Digital Vertical Slice
1. Open your learning log and iterate on your user stories & wireframe based on the feedback of the last datalab session.
2. Define what needs to change in your design in order to accomodate the iterated user stories. If you come up with any other changes to your application design, now is the time to write it down and document it.
3. Iterate on the vertical slice of your wireframe prototype based on your design. Make sure it accomodates and integrates all new design requirements you set yourself.
4. Based on your application, user stories and what you just learned about user testing. [Select a user testing method for Proto.io](https://support.proto.io/hc/en-us/articles/220363528-Getting-feedback) and justify in your design document why you are running with this type of user test or feedback collection method.
5. Deploy the user test you selected and test whether it works. We're going to run it with your peers next Datalab!

**Save your Wireframe Prototype to Github by exporting is a .zip file, name it 'HCAI_Wireframe_[NameOfApplication]_[StudentName]' (if you didn't do so already) and note what your did in your work- and learning log; and link your .zip file as evidence.**

## 3) Prototyping: Making your prototype holistic
Our core funtionality is now ready to be tested! Great, the next feature we need is the UI to support those core features: the main menu! There might be other important features to prototype such as a settings tab for using the camera to do computer vision, or maybe you also use audio or internet connectivity?

Maybe there are important pieces of information regarding the AI to communicate to the user? Or maybe the user needs to label some information in order to assist the algorithm or the development of the application itself via crowdsourcing?

## Next up!
Coming Datalab we will reflect on user feedback and user testing again and give you an opportunity to ask any questions you might have.
