# Final Assignment: Machine Learning Analysis

Machine learning in this course is assessed by your data analysis on the Oosterhout dataset. During the machine learning modules we will cover several analytical techniques and your are tasked to apply the most suitable technique to answer your research question.

## Pre-requisites
By the time we start exploring machine learning you should have:
1. created a research questions based on the problem statement;
2. a preprocessed of the Oosterhout dataset in powerBI;
3. a .csv file extracted from the Oosterhout dataset relevant to your research question.

And finally, when we finished you should have completed module 1 tot 10 of the codecademy course ["Basics of Machine Learning"](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/machine-learning).
