## Questions or issues?
If you have any questions, please first ask your peers or send us a message on teams instead!

Good luck!


## 1) Mock Assessment Review
Now, let's all find a partner and get our mock-assessments out and discuss them. Specifically, analyse and evaluate one another's machine learning analysis proposals. Explain to one another what analysis you chose, why you chose it and why the analysis is suitable.

Ask us in case you have any questions you can't figure out between the two of you.

## 2) Yelp Regression Project
Now, we're introduced to TOPIC it's time ground down these fundamental by doing a workshop. Open the [Basics of Machine Learning course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/machine-learning) on Codecademy and complete the first module: **Yelp Regression Project**.


## 3) Oosterhout Dataset: Multiple Regression
1. Create a python script called MultipleRegressionOosterhout and save it to your GitHub repository.
2. Open your research design and formulate a multiple regression analysis based on your research question. Start by listing the variables which you think could predict the outcome you're interested in. Write your argumentation down in a in-line comment.
3. Create your fully fitted model under the python code you just wrote.
4. Test, re-fit and validate your model. Create a new model in-line for every re-fit. Keep track of any predictor variables you exclude from the full model when re-fitting. Motivate why you are excluding; or including new variables using comments.
5. Continue till 16:00, or stop when you feel you can no longer improve the model.

## 3) In-Class discussion
At 16:00, there's an meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Next week, we will start diving into reporting and data visualisation practices.

Next week, we will cover classification algorithms!

## Questions or issues?
If you have any questions, please first ask your peers or send us a message on teams instead! We're available on working days from 9:00 tot 17:00.
