If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask us in the in-class discussion at 16:00!


Good luck!


## 2) Yelp Regression Project
Now, we're introduced to TOPIC it's time ground down these fundamental by doing a workshop. Open the [Basics of Machine Learning course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/machine-learning) on Codecademy and complete the first module: **Logistic Regression**.


## 3) Oosterhout Dataset: Classification
1. Create a python script called ClassificationOosterhout and save it to your GitHub repository.
2. Perform Logistic regression on Oosterhout dataset

## 4) Oosterhout Dataset: The learning curve (optional)

A learning curve, shows you how the error (i.e. difference between predicted and true response value for a given observation) of an ML model changes as the size of the training set increases or decreases. In doing so, it provides you with valuable information about how biased and/or varied your data is, and how your model copes with these two error types. For more information on the bias-variance trade-off, see FortmannÂ´s article.

The following questions will give you some guidance, while you are training and/or evaluation your ML model:

__2a__ Try to connect three learning curve variations (presented in Figure 1-3) to the relevant description. For example, Learning curve 1 = Low bias & low variance, Learning curve 2 = High bias & low variance etc. Being able to identify these three learning curve variations, will help you in selecting, and subsequently evaluating you ML model (e.g. logistic regression).

__Learning curve variations:__

Low bias & low variance. Characteristics:

- Relatively small error
- Small difference between the error from the train and validation set.

Low bias & high variance. Characteristics:

- Relatively small training error.
- Large difference between the error from the train and validation set.
- Downward trend in validation error indicates that the model's performance will improve with the increase of data.

High bias & low variance. Characteristics:

- Relatively large training error.
- Small difference between the error from the train and validation set.
- Train and validation error diverges rapidly.

__2b__ The training error provides information on the performance of your ML model in terms of a) variance or b) bias. Explain your answer.

__2c__ The difference between the train set error and validation set provides information on the performance of your ML model in terms of a) variance or b) bias. Explain your answer.

__2d__ visit the website of [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_learning_curve.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-learning-curve-py) for an Jupyter notebook on plotting learning curves.

## 3) In-Class discussion
At 16:00, there's a meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Next week, we will start diving into Topic.
