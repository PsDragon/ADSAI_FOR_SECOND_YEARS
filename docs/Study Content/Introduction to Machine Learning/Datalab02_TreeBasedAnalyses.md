# Datalab 02: Tree-Based Analyses

We start with applying decision trees to the Oosterhout dataset. Please use the
same research question you developed for your classification datalab.


Table of contents:
1. Oosterhout Dataset: Tree based Analysis
2. Random forests



## 1) Oosterhout Dataset: Classification using decision trees
1. Create a python script called ClassificationOosterhout and save it to your GitHub repository.

## 2) Random Forests
 When you have completed with your analyses on the Oosterhout data, please
 Open the [Basics of Machine Learning course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/machine-learning)
 on Codecademy and complete the module **Random Forests**.

## 3) In-Class discussion
At 16:00, there's a meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.
