# Datalab 03: Clustering Analyses

We start with the Handwriting Recognition using K-Means clustering project from Codecademy to put the knowledge and skills we gained yesterday to the test. Then we apply our knowlegde and skills to the research challenge/question we set ourselves for the creative brief. It's all quite straightforward really!


## 0) Learning Objectives:
1. Understand and apply a clustering algorithm.


Table of contents:
1. Handwriting Recognition using K-Means: 3 hours
2. Oosterhout Dataset: Classification Analysis: 3 hours

## Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask us in the in-class discussion at 16:00!


Good luck!


## 1) Handwriting Recognition using K-Means
The U.S. Postal Service has been using machine learning and scanning technologies since 1999. Because its postal offices have to look at roughly half a billion pieces of mail every day, they have done extensive research and developed very efficient algorithms for reading and understanding addresses. And not only the post office: ATMs can recognize handwritten bank checks. Evernote can recognize handwritten task lists. Expensify can recognize handwritten receipts. But how do they do it?

In this codecademy project, you will be using K-means clustering (the algorithm behind this magic) and scikit-learn to cluster images of handwritten digits and predict a handwritten digit.

## 2) Oosterhout Dataset: Classification
Create a python script called ClassificationOosterhout and save it to your GitHub repository.
Apply a suitable clsuter analysis to the Oosterhout dataset.


## 3) In-Class discussion
At 16:00, there's a meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Next week, we will start diving into the Perceptron algorithms.
