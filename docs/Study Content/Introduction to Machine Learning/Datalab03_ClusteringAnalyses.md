# Datalab 03: Clustering Analyses

We start with the Handwriting Recognition using K-Means clustering project from Codecademy to put the knowledge and skills we gained yesterday to the test. Then we apply our knowlegde and skills to the research challenge/question we set ourselves for the creative brief. It's all quite straightforward really!


## 0) Learning Objectives:
1. Understand and apply a clustering algorithm.


Table of contents:
0. Stand-up: 0.5 Hours
1. Q&A: 0.5 hours
1. Handwriting Recognition using K-Means: 3 hours
2. Oosterhout Dataset: Classification Analysis: 3 hours

## Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material after the Q&A, please first ask your peers or ask us if you can't figure it out together!


Good luck!

## 0) Stand-up
We start by hosting a stand-up. Form groups of ~ 5 and run on-another through the following points:
- What progress have you made up since last datalab?
- What progress do you anticipate to make today?
- What impediments are you facing or expecting?
- With what could you use help or support?

**Open your worklog and plan your day informed by the stand-up and today's schedule**

## 1) Q & A
We start by briefly reflecting on what we learned about classification algoritms, overfitting and the bias-variance trade-off. Do you have any questions? Now is the time to ask them!

## 2) Handwriting Recognition using K-Means
The U.S. Postal Service has been using machine learning and scanning technologies since 1999. Because its postal offices have to look at roughly half a billion pieces of mail every day, they have done extensive research and developed very efficient algorithms for reading and understanding addresses. And not only the post office: ATMs can recognize handwritten bank checks. Evernote can recognize handwritten task lists. Expensify can recognize handwritten receipts. But how do they do it?

In this codecademy project, you will be using K-means clustering (the algorithm behind this magic) and scikit-learn to cluster images of handwritten digits and predict a handwritten digit.

## 3) Oosterhout Dataset: Cluster Analysis
### Document your code
Write your argumentation down in a in-line comments; and for every line of code: write an in-line comment explaining what the line of code does exactly. Figure 1. below is a good demonstration of documented code.

The [example script](https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/ADS-AI/tree/main/docs/Study%20Content/DataScience/assets/DS2_Example) I provided in Data Science 1 is also a good example of how to document your code; albeit that one was done in R.

0. Open your python file (MachineLearning_OosterhoutModels_...) used for the final delivery of your model.
1. Load in the youthcare dataset you created in Business Intelligence if you haven't done so already. Load in any other data you might need. Then save your file to your GitHub repository.
2. Open your research design and use in-line comments to  formulate a classification analysis using cluster analysis based on your research question (or when not answerable using this type of analysis: perform an analysis related to your research question). Start by listing the variables which you think could predict the outcome variable you're interested in and motivate why you think they might predict your outcome variable.
3. Create your fully fitted model (so the model containing all variables you wrote down in step 2) under the python code you just wrote.
4. Test, re-fit and validate your model. Create a new model on a new line for every re-fit. Keep track of any predictor variables you exclude from the full model when re-fitting. Motivate why you are excluding; or including new variables using in-line comments.
5. Continue till 16:00, or stop when you feel you can no longer improve the model. Then save your file to your GitHub repository.


## 4) In-Class discussion
At 16:00, there's a meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Next week, we will start diving into the Perceptron algorithms.
