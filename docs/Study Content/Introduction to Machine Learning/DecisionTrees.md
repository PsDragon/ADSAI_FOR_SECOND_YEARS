# Decision Trees

We start with a introduction to tree based analysis, and in particular decision trees and random forests.

## Today's Learning Objectives:

- [ ] Understand tree-based models.
- [ ] Implement a tree-based algorithm using ```scikit-learn```.

## Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask us in the Q&A in Datalab! Further, please use the review sessions on Friday to get help from your peers and the instructors.

Good luck!


## Introduction

A decision tree is an example of a **supervised learning** algorithm that can be either used for regression or classification. In some cases, you may come across the terms regression trees, and classification trees - which are nothing but decision tree algorithms for regression and classification respectively. In this module, we will focus on classification trees.

:bell: A decision tree is a machine learning model that is used for both regression and classification tasks. It is a supervised learning algorithm, which means that it is trained using labeled data. The decision tree is a flowchart-like structure, tracing the possible outcomes of a decision based on certain conditions. 

Please watch the following video to get a better understanding of decision trees:

# Blended Learning: DataCamp

In this module, we will be using DataCamp to learn about decision trees. Please complete the section **Classification and Regression Trees** in the course [Machine Learning with Tree-Based Models in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/machine-learning-with-tree-based-models-in-python).


## Preparation for the DataLab

Tomorrow in the DataLab we will continue working on the use-cases. Please ensure that you are prepared.

- [ ] Completed the [writing] homework assignments based on Making Friends with Machine Learning and uploaded ``````LogisticRegressionAlgorithms.md`````` to your GitHub repository.
