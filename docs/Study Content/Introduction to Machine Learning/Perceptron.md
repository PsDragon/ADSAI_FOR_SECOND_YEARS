Good luck!


## 1) Introduction

Some people think of Perceptor every time they hear the word perceptron. Both are linked to the field of science (i.e. The Perceptor is a scientist, while the perceptron was developed by a scientist, Frank Rosenblatt). However, they are quite distinct. For example, I think the perceptron is way cooler than the Perceptor. What do you think?

## 2) Workshop Perceptron
Now, we're introduced to the perceptron it's time ground down these fundamental by doing a workshop. Open the [Basics of Machine Learning course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/machine-learning) on Codecademy and complete the module: **Perceptron**.

## 3) Mock assessment: The perceptron

__3a__ Watch the video Supervised learning: The perceptron by Crash Course.

*Video 1. Supervised learning: The perceptron by Crash Course.*

__3b__ Define the term 'perceptron'. Write your answer down (maximum 100 words).

__3c__ Read [The Perceptron - A Guided Tutorial Through Its History and Implementation In Python](https://pabloinsente.github.io/the-perceptron) by Pablo Caceres.

__3d__ After completing the tutorial by Pablo Caceres, would you provide the same answer to exercise 1b? Explain your answer.

## 3) Mock assessment: Stochastic Gradient Descent & Backpropagation

- Derivatives
- Step vs. sigmoid activation function

# 4)  In-Class discussion
At 16:00, there's a online meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Tomorrow we will cover TOPIC!
