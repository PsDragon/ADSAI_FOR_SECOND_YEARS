# Random Forests
Today, we will teach completely in the spirit of decision trees: the decison is up to you! We present you with two different paths: you can either:
- learn about another form of decision trees: Random Forests
OR
- work on content you haven't finished yet like a previous workshop or your something for creative brief.

We'll get back to decision trees in year 2, so you won't miss out; don't worry!

## 0) Learning Objectives:
1. Become more comfortable and competent in understanding and applying tree-based analyses.

Table of contents:
1. Introduction to concepts: X hours
2. Workshop: Y hours


## Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask us in the Q&A in Datalab!

## 2) Workshop
Now, we're introduced to TOPIC it's time ground down these fundamental by doing a workshop. Open the [Basics of Machine Learning course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/machine-learning) on Codecademy and complete the module: **Decision Trees**, specifically:
- Lesson: Random Forests
- Quiz: Random Forests
- Project: Predicting Income with Random Forests



# 3) Q&A
Coming Datalab we will reflect on tree-based analyses again and give you an opportunity to ask any questions you might have.


## Up Next!
Tomorrow we will apply a tree-based analyses on our research problem/question for the Oosterhout Dataset! You're also given extra time to work on other stuff or complete the random forests course material on codecademy.
