# Regression Algorithms

We start with a refresher on regression algorithms from the last block. We will then continue with the workshop, which covers simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. The workshop will consist of some interactive lessons, two short quizzes and a mini-project about honey production.

## 0) Learning Objectives:
After this module you'll know the fundamental theory on, and how to:
1. Understand and apply simple linear regression
2. Understand and apply multiple linear regression

Table of contents:
1. Regression refresher: 0.5 hours
2. Workshop: 7 hours



## Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask us in the Q&A in Datalab!

Good luck!



## 1) A refresher on Regression
Now, we already covered the basics of regression last block, but if you feel you could use a refresher, you should watch the video below. Otherwise, continue straight to the workshop!

Regression analyses, whether they are linear, multiple or logistic, are a very powerful statistical tool! In fact, if you can answer a question or predict an outcome by simply using an easy regression model, it's probably the way to go: there's no need to overly complicate you analyses.

## 2) Workshop
Now, we refreshed our knowledge on regression, it's time to deepen our understanding of regression by doing a workshop. Open the [Basics of Machine Learning course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/machine-learning) on Codecademy and complete the modules: **Linear Regression** and **Multiple Linear Regression**.


# 3) Daily Q&A
Coming Datalab we will reflect on regression algorithms again and give you an opportunity to ask any questions you might have.

Tomorrow we will do a mock-assessment with the famous Yelp data and we start working on our analyses for the Oosterhout Dataset!
