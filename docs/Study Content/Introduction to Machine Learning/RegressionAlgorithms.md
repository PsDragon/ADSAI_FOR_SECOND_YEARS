Open the [Basics of Machine Learning course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/machine-learning) on Codecademy and complete the modules: **Linear Regression** and **Multiple Linear Regression**.


# 3)  In-Class discussion
At 16:00, there's a online meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Tomorrow we will do a mock-assessment with the famous Yelp data and we start working on our analyses for the Oosterhout Dataset!
