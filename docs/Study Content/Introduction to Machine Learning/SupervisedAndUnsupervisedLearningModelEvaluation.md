## 1) Introduction machine learning
From spam filters and self-driving cars, to cutting edge medical diagnosis and real-time language translation, there has been an increasing need for our computers to learn from data and apply that knowledge to make predictions and decisions. This is the heart of machine learning which sits inside the more ambitious goal of artificial intelligence.

Today, we're going to look towards the future at how machine learning is being used to build models to predict future outcomes. We'll discuss three popular types of supervised machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Linear discriminant Analysis (or LDA) and K Nearest Neighbors (or KNN).

Next, we're going to discuss how machine learning can be used to group and label information even if those labels don't exist. We'll explore two types of clustering used in Unsupervised Machine Learning: k-means and Hierarchical clustering, and show how they can be used in many ways - from book suggestions and medical interventions, to giving people better deals on pizza!

## 2) Workshop on Supervised Vs Unsupervised Learning
Now, we're introduced to the two flavours of machine learning it's time ground down these fundamental by doing a workshop. Open the [Basics of Machine Learning course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/machine-learning) on Codecademy and complete the first module: **Introduction to Machine Learning**.

## 3)  Daily Q&A
At 16:00, there's a online meeting you're encouraged to take part in to ask questions and to discuss our progress and reflect on today activities.

Tomorrow we will cover regression algorithms!

## Questions or issues?
If you have any questions, please first ask your peers or send us a message on teams instead! We're available on working days from 9:00 tot 17:00.
