# Supervised Learning: A Recap

Please use today to revise some of the key concepts in supervised Learning
you have been introduced to during the course.

## Today's learning objectives - Revise key concepts

- [ ] KNN [Supervised Learning with scikit-learn](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn){:target="_blank"}
- [ ] Logistic regression [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/understanding-logistic-regression-python){:target="_blank"}.
- [ ] Decision trees [Machine Learning with Tree-Based Models in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/machine-learning-with-tree-based-models-in-python){:target="_blank"}.

## Supervised Learning - Random Forests

When you are sufficiently confident in your supervised learning abilities,
open the[Machine Learning with Tree-Based Models in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/machine-learning-with-tree-based-models-in-python){:target="_blank"}. and complete the module of the module: **Bagging and Random Forests**.
