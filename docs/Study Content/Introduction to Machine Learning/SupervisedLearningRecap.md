# Supervised Learning: A Recap

Please use today to revise some of the key concepts in [supervised Learning](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/top-machine-learning-use-cases-and-algorithms)
you have been introduced to during the course.

## Today's learning objectives - Revise key concepts

- [ ] [K Nearest Neighbours](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning/ClassificationAlgorithms.html){:target="_blank"}
- [ ] [Linear regression](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning/RegressionAlgorithms.html){:target="_blank"}
- [ ] [Logistic regression](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning/LogisticRegressionAlgorithms.html){:target="_blank"}.
- [ ] [Decision trees](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning/DecisionTrees.html){:target="_blank"}.
- [ ] [Hyperparameter Tuning](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning/HyperparameterTuning.html){:target="_blank"}.

## Supervised Learning: More models!

If you are curious to learn more supervised learning models out there, please use the following resources.

- [ ] Random Forests: open the[Machine Learning with Tree-Based Models in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/machine-learning-with-tree-based-models-in-python){:target="_blank"}. and complete the module of the module: **Bagging and Random Forests**.

- [ ] [XGBOOST](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/xgboost-in-python).

- [ ] [Deep Learning](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/tutorial-deep-learning-tutorial)

:bell: Use the [cheat sheet](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/supervised-machine-learning-cheat-sheet) to learn more about the differences between the different flavours of models available.

:bell: Please remember to fill in your learning and work logs!

## Please use the rest of the day to work on your Final Report.

Note that your report should contain the following sections:

- [ ] Introduction to the business case.
- [ ] Introduction to the datasets used.
    - [ ] A paragraph on data cleaning and preparation.
    - [ ] A paragraph on data exploration including visualisations.
- [ ] Introduction to the machine learning models used.
    - [ ] A paragraph describing the model
- [ ] A section describing the results obtained using the models.
- [ ] A section on ethical aspects.

For more information on the report and specific writing requirements, please refer to the Project Specifications you can find [here](https://adsai.buas.nl/Year1/BlockB/Project%20Requirements/ReportRequirements.html).
