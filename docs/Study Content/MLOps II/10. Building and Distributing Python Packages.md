# Building and Distributing Python Packages

As a data science student, you've likely spent most of your time working with Jupyter Notebooks, analyzing data, and building models. While notebooks are an excellent tool for exploration and prototyping, there comes a time when you need to transition your code into a more structured, reusable, and shareable format. That's where packaging your Python projects comes into play! 📦

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. [ ] 🧠 **Remember** the basic concepts and steps involved in packaging and sharing Python projects using Poetry. (Knowledge)

2. [ ] 💡 **Understand** the benefits of packaging Python projects and how it applies to data science, including reusability, collaboration, versioning, dependency management, and deployment. (Comprehension)

3. [ ] ⚙️ **Apply** the process of creating, building, and sharing a Python package using Poetry by generating .whl files and publishing to PyPI. (Application)

4. [ ] 🔎 **Analyze** and troubleshoot issues related to Python project packaging, dependencies, and distribution, ensuring that your code is compatible with various environments and use cases. (Analysis)


## 1. What is a Python Package?

A Python package is a collection of Python modules that can be installed and used together. A package can contain any number of modules, as well as other resources like data files, images, and documentation. Packages are the primary way to share and reuse Python code, and they are the standard unit of distribution for Python libraries and applications.
🌟 Introduction: Why Packaging Python Projects Matters for Data Science Students 📊🔬

Here are a few reasons why learning to package your Python projects using tools like Poetry is essential for data science students:

1. 🔄 **Reusability**: Packaging your data processing or machine learning code into a library allows you to reuse it in multiple projects without duplicating your code. This makes your work more efficient and helps you maintain consistency across projects.

2. 👥 **Collaboration**: Sharing your code as a package makes it easier for others to use, understand, and contribute to your work. By publishing your package on PyPI or sharing .whl files, you enable teammates and the broader data science community to install and use your code with ease.

3. 📚 **Versioning**: When you package your code, you can easily manage different versions of your library. This allows you and others to update, rollback or switch between versions, ensuring stability and compatibility across projects.

4. 🔧 **Dependency Management**: Packaging tools like Poetry help you manage your project's dependencies, ensuring that your code works with the correct library versions. This is crucial when sharing your work with others, as it prevents dependency conflicts and ensures that your code runs as expected.

5. 🚀 **Deployment**: Packaging your code is often the first step toward deploying your data science models or tools in a production environment. By turning your code into a package, you can more easily integrate it with web applications, APIs, or other production systems.

By learning how to build and share Python packages, you will level up your data science skills, making your work more accessible, reusable, and maintainable. It's an essential skill for taking your data science projects from the notebook to the real world. 🌏💼

## 2. Building Python Packages with Poetry

In this section, we'll learn how to build Python projects 🐍 and and create shareable packages using Poetry. 🎁

1. 🛠️ Prerequisites:

   - Ensure you have Python installed (3.6+). 
   - Ensure you have Poetry installed.
   - You should already have a poetry python project set up. If not, see the [Poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/) for instructions.
   - You should also already have a `pyproject.toml` file in your project directory from when you set up your project.

2. 🎯 Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd my_project
   ```

   Of course you will need to replace `my_project` with the name of your project directory. 📂

3. 🔐 Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   Run the following command to create a virtual environment and install your project's dependencies:

   ```
   poetry install
   ```
   You have probably already done this when you set up your project. If you have already created a virtual environment and installed your dependencies, you can skip this step. 🏃 You can also just run `poetry install` to update your dependencies if you've made changes to your `pyproject.toml` file.

4. 📦 Build your project:

   Now that you have a virtual environment and all your dependencies installed, you can build your project using Poetry. 🏗️

   ```
   poetry build
   ```
   This will generate two files in the `dist` directory: a `.tar.gz` source archive and a `.whl` (wheel) file. 🎡


## 3. Distributing Python Packages with Poetry

Well done! You've successfully built your Python project. 🎉 Now you can share your package with others by simply sharing the `.whl` file or publishing it to PyPI. 🌐

### 3.1 Sharing and Installing .whl Files Locally :wheel_of_dharma:

Sometimes, you might want to share your Python project as a .whl file directly, especially if you don't want to publish it on PyPI or need to distribute it privately. It is also an easy way to test your package before publishing it to PyPI.

Here's how to do it:

a. __Locate the .whl file:__

After running `poetry build`, you will find the .whl file in the `dist` directory. This directory is created automatically in your project directory when you run `poetry build`. The file should look like something this: `my_project-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`, except with the name of your project and the correct version number.

b. __Share the .whl file:__

Send the .whl file to the person who wants to install your package or upload it to a shared location, such as a private server, cloud storage, or an internal package repository.

c. __Install the .whl file:__

To install the .whl file, the person receiving it needs to use `pip`. They should first download the .whl file to their local machine, then run the following command:

```
pip install /path/to/my_project-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/` with the actual path to the .whl file on their computer.

:pencil: 3.1a Create a .whl file for your creative brief project and share it with a friend. Then have them install it using `pip`.

That's it! Now you know how to share and install .whl files directly without using PyPI. 🌟 Keep in mind that when distributing .whl files this way, you'll need to manually handle updates, versioning, and dependency management.

### 3.2 Publishing to PyPI 🌐

Now that you know how to build your project and create a .whl file, you can publish your package to PyPI. Publishing your package to PyPI makes it easy for others to install your package using `pip` or `poetry` over the internet. 


- Register for an account on PyPI (https://pypi.org/) and PyPI Test (https://test.pypi.org/) if you haven't already.
- Set up API tokens 🔑 for both PyPI and PyPI Test. (https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/)
- Run the following command to publish your package to PyPI Test:

    ```
    poetry publish --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ --build
    ```
    
- Once you're confident that your package is ready for prime time, publish it to the real PyPI:

    ```
    poetry publish --build
    ```

The difference between the two commands is that the first one publishes your package to PyPI Test, while the second one publishes it to the real PyPI. PyPI Test is a sandbox for testing your package before publishing it to the real PyPI. It's a good idea to test your package on PyPI Test first to make sure everything works as expected.

🎉 Congrats! You've successfully built and shared your Python project using Poetry. 🌐 Now others can easily install your package using `pip`:

```
pip install my_project
```

:pencil: 3.2a Publish your creative brief project to PyPI Test and share it with a friend. Then have them install it using `pip`.

:pencil: 3.2b Publish your creative brief project to PyPI and share it with a friend. Then have them install it using `pip`.
