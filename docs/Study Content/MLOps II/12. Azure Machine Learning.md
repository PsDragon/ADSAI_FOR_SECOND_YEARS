## 1. Levels of MLOps and ML OPs Tools 🛠️

To streamline and classify the MLOps process, Microsoft has introduced the MLOps Maturity Model. The model outlines five levels of maturity, each of which corresponds to a different stage of implementation and sophistication of MLOps practices within an organization. You have already seen the MLOps Maturity Model in the previous module, but now we take a closer look 🔍 at the model and how it can be applied in Azure Machine Learning using different Azure tools and services 🛠️.

Microsoft's MLOps approach is structured around a maturity model, which helps organizations understand their current maturity level and plan their roadmap for MLOps implementation🗺️. The model comprises five levels:

1. Level 0 - No MLOps: At this stage, processes are largely manual and driven by data scientists, with little to no automation in place🚦.
2. Level 1 - DevOps, no MLOps: Similar to Level 0, but some basic integration tests are added🚧.
3. Level 2 - Automated Training: Training processes are tracked, and model artifacts are captured in a repeatable way, but release processes remain manual, and app integration still relies heavily on data scientists📊.
4. Level 3 - Automated Model Deployment: Automation extends to model deployment, with a CI/CD pipeline set up for automated releases, but human signoff is still required✅.
5. Level 4 - Full MLOps: At this level, retraining is automated based on metrics from the application, and A/B testing is added to the CI/CD pipeline. Human signoff may still be needed, but unit and integration tests are in place, and the process is largely automated🚀.

Moving from level 0 (No MLOps) to level 4 (Full MLOps), the model guides the transition from untracked, manual processes to fully automated, version-controlled workflows with sophisticated metric tracking and testing protocols. The goal is to ensure consistent quality control, streamline the machine learning lifecycle, and enable rapid and reliable deployment of ML models.

We will be using Azure Machine Learning to manage the lifecycle of machine learning models. This includes creating reproducible machine learning pipelines, registering, packaging, and deploying models, tracking lineage information, sending alerts and notifications for various events in the ML lifecycle, and monitoring ML applications for operational and ML-related issues. 


## 2. Azure Machine Learning [[docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?view=azureml-api-2)] 

Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) 🧠 is a powerful platform designed to handle every stage of the machine learning lifecycle. It provides robust capabilities that streamline and automate the end-to-end process, from managing your data 📊 to deploying your models 🚀. Each component within Azure ML plays a crucial role in the overall workflow and contributes to a more efficient and productive machine learning process.

</div>

The journey starts with __Data__ 🗂️. As the lifeblood of any machine learning project, Azure ML provides tools to manage and version your datasets. This not only keeps your data organized 📚 but also ensures robust data governance 🛡️.

Next, we move on to __Jobs__ 👷. These are essentially the tasks or operations that perform the model training. Think of them as the workhorses that carry out the heavy lifting in your machine learning projects.

Then, we have __Components__ 🧩. These are the modular building blocks of your machine learning pipelines in Azure. Each step of the process, whether it's data preprocessing, feature extraction, or model training, can be a component. This modular approach enhances flexibility and makes the workflow more manageable.

Up next are __Pipelines__ 🏭. Just as in a manufacturing assembly line, pipelines in Azure ML help orchestrate your machine learning tasks. They allow you to automate workflows, from data preprocessing to model deployment, thereby reducing manual intervention and increasing efficiency.

Dealing with software dependencies can often be a hassle, but not with Azure ML's __Environments__ 🌳. They help track and manage software dependencies, ensuring reproducibility and consistency across different stages of the machine learning lifecycle.

Now, let's talk about __Models__ 🏛️. Azure ML offers a robust Model Registry for storing, versioning, and managing all your trained machine learning models. Each model is tracked and versioned, making it easier to manage your models' lifecycle.

Finally, we reach __Endpoints__ 🎯. Once your models are ready to make predictions, they're deployed to endpoints. Models are packaged into Docker images before deployment, and they can be deployed as endpoints in the cloud or locally🌐. Deployment configurations include providing the models, an entry script, a Machine Learning environment, and other necessary assets. Azure ML supports both real-time scoring with online endpoints and large scale scoring with batch endpoints.



It's important to note that Azure Machine Learning provides the capability to track the end-to-end audit trail of all your machine learning assets using metadata. This can be particularly useful for understanding how models arrive at results for specific inputs, meeting regulatory compliance, and maintaining healthy deployments🔒. 

Understanding these components and how they interact is key 🔑 to leveraging the full potential of Azure ML. The platform's comprehensive capabilities provide you with the tools needed to develop high-quality machine learning solutions, all while maintaining efficiency and productivity 💪.

Please complete the following course from Microsoft to learn more about Azure Machine Learning:

- [Intro to Azure ML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/intro-to-azure-ml/) 📚

This course will give you a high-level overview of Azure Machine Learning and its capabilities. It will also introduce you to the various components of Azure ML and how they work together to streamline the machine learning lifecycle. :100:

### 2.1 Azure ML Workspace

All the assets mentioned above are stored in an Azure ML Workspace. The workspace is the top-level resource for Azure Machine Learning, providing a centralized place to work with all the artifacts you create when you use Azure Machine Learning. It provides data scientists, ML engineers, and IT professionals with a single view of all the experiments and models in a workspace. The workspace also provides a centralized place to manage the compute targets you use for training and inference.

Complete the following course from Microsoft to learn more about Azure ML Workspace:
- [Explore the Azure ML Workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/explore-azure-machine-learning-workspace/) 📚

This course will give you a high-level overview of the Azure Machine Learning workspace and how to interact with it. You will also be introduced to the Azure ML SDK, which is a Python package that allows you to interact with Azure ML programmatically. In both parts of this course, you will be first be run through the concepts and then be given a hands-on lab to practice what you've learned. Later in the module we will work through an end-to-end example of using Azure ML to train and deploy a machine learning model with the MNIST project that you have been working on. :1234:

### 2.3 Compute

Explain what a compute target is and how to list and select compute targets.

Make the lesson on creating compute optional.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/work-compute-azure-machine-learning/

Use a compute cluster
There are three main scenarios in which you'll want to use a compute cluster:

Running a pipeline job you built in the Designer.
Running an Automated Machine Learning job.
Running a script as a job.
In each of these scenarios, a compute cluster is ideal as a compute cluster will automatically scale up when a job is submitted, and automatically shut down when a job is completed.

A compute cluster will also allow you to train multiple models in parallel, which is a common practice when using Automated Machine Learning.

You can run a Designer pipeline job and an Automated Machine Learning job through the Azure Machine Learning studio. When you submit the job through the studio, you can set the compute target to the compute cluster you created.

When you prefer a code-first approach, you can set the compute target to your compute cluster by using the Python SDK.

For example, when you run a script as a command job, you can set the compute target to your compute cluster with the following code:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import command

# configure job
job = command(
    code="./src",
    command="python diabetes-training.py",
    environment="AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu@latest",
    compute="cpu-cluster",
    display_name="train-with-cluster",
    experiment_name="diabetes-training"
    )

# submit job
returned_job = ml_client.create_or_update(job)
aml_url = returned_job.studio_url
print("Monitor your job at", aml_url)
```

After submitting a job that uses a compute cluster, the compute cluster will scale out to one or more nodes. Resizing will take a few minutes, and your job will start running once the necessary nodes are provisioned. When a job's status is preparing, the compute cluster is being prepared. When the status is running, the compute cluster is ready, and the job is running.
