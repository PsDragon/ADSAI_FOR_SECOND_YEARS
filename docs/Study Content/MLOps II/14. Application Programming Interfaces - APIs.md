## 1. What is an API? ü§î

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. It defines the methods and data formats that a program can use to communicate with other programs or components. An API (Application Programming Interface) can be seen as a contract between different software components on how to interact with each other. APIs are central to modern software development and have several key benefits:

1. **Abstraction**: APIs allow developers to abstract away the complexities of a system and provide a simple interface to interact with it.

2. **Interoperability**: APIs enable different software systems to communicate and share data with each other, regardless of the programming languages or technologies used to build them.

3. **Modularity and Scalability**: APIs provide a modular approach to software development, where different components of a system can be developed, tested, and scaled independently.

4. **Automation**: APIs allow software components to interact programmatically, enabling automation and reducing manual work.

## 2. Understanding REST APIs üåê

You may have heard the term "REST API" before, but what does it mean? REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. A REST API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. Most modern web services and APIs are RESTful, meaning they conform to the REST architectural style. 

REST APIs are based on HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and use HTTP methods to read, create, update, and delete data:

1. **GET**: Retrieve a specific resource (by id) or a collection of resources.
2. **POST**: Create a new resource.
3. **PUT**: Update a specific resource (by id).
4. **DELETE**: Remove a specific resource by id.

REST APIs also use status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. Some common HTTP status codes include:

- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **201 Created**: The request was successful, and a new resource was created as a result.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication failed or user doesn't have permissions for the requested operation.
- **404 Not Found**: Resource was not found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An error occurred on the server.

We will see these HTTP methods and status codes in action in the examples in later sections.

## Using REST APIs ‚öôÔ∏è

Interacting with a REST API involves making HTTP requests to its endpoints, which are URLs that correspond to resources. Here's a basic example of what interacting with a REST API might look like in Python, using the `requests` library:

‚ö†Ô∏è This is just an example to illustrate the basic idea of interacting with a REST API in python using the `requests` library. The code is not meant to be run as-is. ‚ö†Ô∏è

```python
import requests
import json

# The base URL of the API
base_url = "https://api.example.com/"

# The endpoint of the resource we want to interact with
endpoint = "items"

# Use the `get` method of the requests library to fetch the resource
response = requests.get(base_url + endpoint)

# If the request was successful (status code 200), print the data
if response.status_code == 200:
    items = json.loads(response.text)
    print(items)
```

In this example, we're making a GET request to the "items" endpoint of the API. If the request is successful, we load the JSON data from the response and print it out.

In real-world usage, you'll typically be doing more than just fetching and printing data. You might be creating, updating, or deleting resources, and you'll likely need to handle various kinds of errors and edge cases. But this example should give you a basic idea of how to interact with a REST API.

In the context of building a REST API, something like FastAPI can help you manage these endpoints and methods, define your data models, handle serialization and validation, and much more, making the process of building a REST API much simpler and more streamlined.

## 3. API Libraries and Frameworks üìö

When building APIs in Python, it's essential to select a framework that aligns with your project's needs, your team's skill set, and the long-term goals of your application. With numerous options available, the choice can sometimes seem overwhelming. In this section, we will explore three popular Python frameworks for building APIs: Flask, Django REST Framework, and FastAPI. Each of these has its own strengths and trade-offs, and the choice between them often depends on the specific requirements of the project at hand. We'll consider several key aspects of these frameworks, such as performance, ease of use, automatic documentation generation, data validation and serialization, asynchronous support, and the size and activity of their developer communities. By the end of this section, you'll have a clear understanding of these different frameworks, enabling you to make an informed decision when starting your next API project. Let's dive in and learn more about these powerful tools. üåü

### Flask üç∂

Flask is a lightweight and flexible framework for building web applications in Python. It's been around since 2010 and is very popular for its simplicity and ease of use. 

Flask doesn't come with a lot of built-in features for building APIs, but it's highly extensible and there are many great extensions available, like Flask-RESTful for building RESTful APIs and Flask-SQLAlchemy for interacting with databases. 

However, Flask doesn't support Python's async and await keywords, which can make it less efficient when handling many simultaneous connections.

### Django REST Framework üèóÔ∏è

Django REST Framework (DRF) is a powerful toolkit for building APIs in Django. It comes with a lot of built-in features, like serialization, query parameter parsing, and authentication. 

Django and DRF are known for their "batteries-included" philosophy, which means they come with a lot of functionality out of the box. This can be a great advantage if you need many of these features, but it can also make Django and DRF feel heavy and complex if you're building a simpler API.

DRF, like Flask, doesn't support async and await, and it can be overkill for simpler APIs.

### FastAPI üöÄ

FastAPI is a newer framework designed specifically for building APIs. It takes advantage of modern Python features like async and await, and type hints. Here are some of the key reasons you might want to choose FastAPI:

1. **Speed**: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks available, comparable to NodeJS and Go in performance. The support for async and await means it can handle many simultaneous connections efficiently.

2. **Ease of use**: FastAPI is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, while providing powerful features. The routing system is simple and flexible, and dependency injection makes it easy to manage and reuse code.

3. **Automatic interactive API documentation**: FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation from your code, which can be a huge time-saver and makes it easier for developers to understand and use your API.

4. **Data validation and serialization**: FastAPI uses Pydantic for data validation and serialization, which leverages Python's type hints to provide automatic validation, serialization, and documentation.

5. **Support for modern Python features**: FastAPI supports modern Python features like async and await for asynchronous programming, and type hints for improved editor support and type checking.

6. **Starlette for web parts and Pydantic for the data parts**: FastAPI is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts. This combination allows it to be a high-performance framework and have data validation off the shelf.

Here is a comparison of the features of FastAPI, Flask, and Django REST Framework:

| Feature                        | Flask | Django REST Framework | FastAPI |
| ------------------------------ | ----- | --------------------- | ------- |
| Performance                    | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ   | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ                   | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  |
| Ease of Use                    | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ                  | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  |
| Automatic Documentation        | ‚òÖ‚òÖ    | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ                  | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  |
| Data Validation & Serialization| ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ   | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ                 | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  |
| Async Support                  | ‚òÖ     | ‚òÖ                     | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  |
| Community & Ecosystem          | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ                 | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ   |

**Performance** ‚ö°: FastAPI is built on Starlette for web parts which makes it one of the fastest Python frameworks available. Flask and Django REST Framework don't support async out of the box, which can limit their performance with many simultaneous connections.

**Ease of Use** üöÄ: Flask is known for its simplicity, while FastAPI is designed to be easy to use but also provides powerful features. Django REST Framework has a steeper learning curve because it includes a lot of built-in features.

**Automatic Documentation** üìö: FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation from your code, a feature not fully supported in Flask without extensions. Django REST Framework provides a built-in browsable API, but it's not as interactive as FastAPI's.

**Data Validation & Serialization** üõ†Ô∏è: FastAPI uses Pydantic for automatic data validation and serialization, a feature not fully supported in Flask without extensions. Django REST Framework also provides strong support for data validation and serialization with serializers.

**Async Support** ‚è©: FastAPI has full support for Python's async and await keywords, which can make it more efficient when handling many simultaneous connections. Flask and Django REST Framework don't have built-in support for these features.

**Community & Ecosystem** üåê: Flask and Django REST Framework have been around for longer and have large communities and ecosystems of plugins and extensions. FastAPI's community is growing quickly, but it's not as established as Flask's or Django's.

FastAPI is a highly suitable choice for data science applications due to its high performance, robust data validation using Pydantic, asynchronous capabilities, and automatic documentation. Its easy learning curve and native Python integration also make it an attractive option for data science teams. The choice of FastAPI should consider project needs, team familiarity, and application complexity.

## 4. FastAPI Deep Dive üöÄ

We will now take a deep dive into FastAPI and explore its key features in more detail. We'll start by looking at how to install FastAPI and then build a simple API. We'll then explore some of FastAPI's key features, including data validation, serialization, and automatic documentation. By the end of this section, you'll have a solid understanding of FastAPI's capabilities and be ready to start building your own APIs. Let's get started! üåü

:books: [FastAPI Tutorial](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/) üìù

</div>

### Setting up the Environment üíª

Before we start, you will need to have Python 3.6 or later installed. You can check your Python version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
```
Next, let's install FastAPI and an ASGI server, such as Uvicorn. You can install both using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```
Uvicorn ü¶Ñ is a lightning-fast ASGI server that supports HTTP/1 and HTTP/2. It's recommended by the FastAPI documentation, but you can use any ASGI server you like. An ASGI server is a server that supports the ASGI protocol, which is the standard for Python asynchronous web servers and frameworks. Don't worry if you're not familiar with ASGI servers or protocols just know that Uvicorn is a good choice for FastAPI.

If you're using a virtual environment, make sure to activate it before installing FastAPI and Uvicorn. If you are using poetry, you can create a new virtual environment and install FastAPI and Uvicorn using the following commands:

```bash
poetry new fastapi-demo
cd fastapi-demo
poetry add fastapi uvicorn
```

### Creating a Basic API with FastAPI üèóÔ∏è

Now that we have our environment set up, let's create a basic API.

1. **Create a new file** üìÅ

   Create a new Python file in your project directory. You can name it `main.py`.

2. **Import FastAPI** üìö

   Open your new `main.py` file in your text editor and import the `FastAPI` class from the `fastapi` module:

   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   ```

3. **Instantiate FastAPI** üèÉ

   Create an instance of the `FastAPI` class. This instance will be our application.

   ```python
   app = FastAPI()
   ```

4. **Define a Route** üó∫Ô∏è

   Now let's create a route. A route is a URL pattern that is used to find the appropriate resource. You define a route by using the `@app.route()` decorator, followed by a function that returns the response for that route:

   ```python
   @app.get("/")
   def read_root():
       return {"Hello": "World"}
   ```

   Here, we are creating a route for the URL "/", and defining a GET operation with the `@app.get("/")` decorator. The function `read_root()` will be executed when a GET request is made to the "/" URL. It returns a JSON response with the message "Hello, World".

   The `@app.get()` decorator is provided by FastAPI and is used to define a route. The `@app.get()` decorator takes a single argument, which is the URL pattern for the route. In this case, we are using the root URL, "/", but you can use any URL pattern you like.

    The function `read_root()` is executed when a GET request is made to the "/" URL. It returns a JSON response with the message "Hello, World".

    The complete code for our API looks like this:

    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI

    app = FastAPI()

    @app.get("/")
    def read_root():
        return {"Hello": "World"}
    ```

5. **Run the API** üöÄ

   Now, you can run your API with Uvicorn. Use the command below in your terminal:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The `main:app` argument means: "run the application (app) located in the main.py file". The `--reload` flag enables hot reloading, which means the server will automatically update whenever you make changes to your code.

That's it! You've just created a basic API with FastAPI. üéâ But how do we interact with it? Let's find out. üëá

#### Interacting in the Browser üåê

One of the simplest ways to interact with our API is directly in the browser. Since our API is running on our local machine, we can use the localhost URL to access it.

1. Start your API by running the command `uvicorn main:app --reload` in your terminal.

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`.

3. You should see the response from our "Hello, World!" API, which is a JSON object: `{"message": "Hello, World!"}`

4. FastAPI also automatically generates interactive API documentation. You can see this by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/docs` in your browser. This page lets you explore your API and make test requests directly from your browser.

#### Interacting with Python üêç

You can also interact with your API using Python, specifically with the `requests` library which allows you to send HTTP requests in Python. Here's how you might do it:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/")

# The .json() method returns the JSON response as a Python dictionary
data = response.json()

print(data)
```

When you run this script, it will print out the response from our "Hello, World!" API: `{'message': 'Hello, World!'}`

Note: Ensure the FastAPI server is running before executing the script. The server and the script should be run in separate terminal windows or separate instances of your IDE.

In both cases, you're making a GET request to the `/` endpoint of your API, and the API is responding with a message: "Hello, World!". This is a basic example, but as your API becomes more complex, you can use these same methods to interact with other endpoints, pass query parameters, send request bodies, and more.
