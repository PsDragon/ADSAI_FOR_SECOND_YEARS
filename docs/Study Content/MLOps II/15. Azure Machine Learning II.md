# Azure Machine Learning II - Model Training, Components, and Pipelines

In this module, we will delve deeper into Azure Machine Learning and explore key concepts related to model training, components, and pipelines. We have previously covered essential topics such as data management, compute environments, and environments setup, which have provided us with a strong foundation. Now, let's expand our knowledge further with the following topics:

## 1. Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning

### 1.1 Why Model Training in Azure (or any public cloud) is Essential for Data Scientists/ML Engineers

Model training is a fundamental step in the machine learning workflow where we teach our algorithms to make predictions or perform tasks based on available data. Azure Machine Learning provides a powerful platform for model training, offering numerous benefits for data scientists and ML engineers:

1. ‚ú® **Scalability**: Azure Machine Learning enables us to scale our training process seamlessly by leveraging the cloud infrastructure. We can train models on large datasets or use distributed computing to parallelize the training process, significantly reducing the time required to train complex models.

2. ‚ôªÔ∏è **Repeatability**: With Azure Machine Learning, we can create reproducible experiments. This means that we can precisely recreate the training environment, including the code, dependencies, and data, ensuring consistent and reliable results. Reproducibility is crucial for collaboration, debugging, and achieving consistent model performance.

3. ‚öôÔ∏è **Automation**: Azure Machine Learning facilitates the automation of the model training process. We can set up pipelines to automate the execution of training jobs, eliminating manual intervention and enabling us to focus on higher-level tasks. Automation saves time, reduces errors, and streamlines the end-to-end machine learning workflow.

Now, let's dive into the specific topics covered in this module.

### 1.2 Running a Script as a Command Job

A common challenge when developing machine learning models is to prepare them for production scenarios. While notebooks are excellent for experimentation and development, scripts are better suited for production workloads. You will have already gone through the task of making your code production ready. In Azure Machine Learning, you can run a script as a command job using the Python Software Development Kit (SDK) v2, this allows you to run your code as a command job in a compute environment in Azure Machine Learning.

When you submit a command job, you can configure various parameters, such as the input data and the compute environment. Azure Machine Learning assists in tracking your work when working with command jobs, making it easier to compare different workloads and assess their performance.

To gain hands-on experience with running scripts as command jobs, we will explore the official Microsoft Learn tutorial: 

- [Train models using scripts in Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/train-models-scripts-azure-machine-learning/). üìö

This tutorial will guide you through the process of running a training script as a command job using the Azure Machine Learning SDK v2 for Python.

### 1.3 Training Multiple Models with Different Hyperparameters

In real-world scenarios, training a single model with default hyperparameters may not yield optimal performance. Hyperparameter tuning involves searching for the best combination of hyperparameters to enhance model performance. Azure Machine Learning simplifies this process by allowing us to train multiple models with different hyperparameters efficiently.

One approach to achieve this is by running multiple job commands in a loop, each with a different set of hyperparameters. Azure Machine Learning helps us manage and track these training jobs effectively, enabling us to compare the performance of different models and choose the best hyperparameter configuration for our specific problem.

Throughout this course, we will explore practical examples and hands-on exercises to train multiple models with different hyperparameters, analyze their results, and select the most promising model configuration. üî¨üí°
