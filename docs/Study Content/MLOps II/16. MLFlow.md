# Creating Reproducible ML Experiments with MLFlow (ðŸš§ Work in progress)

MLFlow Quickstart: https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/quickstart.html

Datacamp course: https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/developing-machine-learning-models-for-production
Do first part of chapter 2.

this course isn't ideal

This tutorial is good: https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/mlflow-streamline-machine-learning-workflow


MLFlow tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QpKeshFZ9Q - RUNAI seems decent
