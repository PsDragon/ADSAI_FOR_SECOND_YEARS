# Advanced GitHub Techniques (ðŸš§ Work in progress)

## Dev/Test/Prod Environments

### Dev Branch

The dev branch is where you will do all of your development work. This is where you will make changes to your code, and where you will test your changes before merging them into the master branch.

### Test Branch

The test branch is where you will do all of your testing work. This is where you will test your code before merging it into the master branch.

### Prod Branch

The prod branch is where you will do all of your production work. This is where you will deploy your code to production.

## GitHub Actions and Workflows

GitHub Actions are a way to automate tasks within GitHub. Workflows are custom automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project on GitHub. GitHub Actions are made up of one or more jobs and can be scheduled or triggered by an event.

### Code Quality Checks on Commit at the GitHub Level

You can set up GitHub Actions to run code quality checks on every commit to your repository. This is a great way to ensure that your code is always up to standard.

### Build and Push Docker Images on Commit

You can set up GitHub Actions to build and push Docker images on every commit to your repository. This is a great way to ensure that your Docker images are always up to date.

### Unit Tests on Commit

You can set up GitHub Actions to run unit tests on every commit to your repository. This is a great way to ensure that your code is always up to standard.
