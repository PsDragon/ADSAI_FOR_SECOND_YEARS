## 🌳 Dev/Test/Production Environments

These environments separate your application's lifecycle stages, promoting organized and efficient development. It's like a software assembly line - features are added in the dev branch, tested in the test branch, and when everything checks out, it's shipped to the production branch for the world to see.

### 🧪 Dev Branch

This branch is for development. It's where you add new features, debug, and perform initial tests. For instance, if you're adding a new machine learning model, you'd do all the training and tuning here. 

The dev branch is like your sandbox 🏖️. It's where you play around with code, adding new features and fixing bugs. Make sure to test your changes thoroughly before merging them into the master branch.

Example:
```bash
# create and checkout to a new dev branch
git checkout -b dev
```
Now you can make changes in this branch without disturbing the main (production-ready) code. 

### 🔍 Test Branch

Once you're confident about your updates in the dev branch, you merge changes into the test branch. Here, the code undergoes rigorous testing, such as integration testing or performance testing, before moving to production.

The test branch is your quality assurance team. It's where you put on your detective hat 🕵️‍♀️ and make sure the new code plays nicely with the old. Test your code here before it goes any further.

Example:
```bash
# merge dev branch into test branch
git checkout test
git merge dev
```
### 🚀 Prod Branch

Once the code passes all tests, it is merged into the prod branch, reflecting the production-ready state of your application.

The prod branch is your launch pad. It's where the world gets to see your hard work. This is where you will deploy your code to production.

Example:
```bash
# merge test branch into main (prod) branch
git checkout main
git merge test
```

On the production branch you will have GitHub Actions workflows that automate the deployment process. For instance, you could have a workflow that builds and pushes a Docker image to DockerHub, and another workflow that deploys the image to a server. This way as soon as you merge your code into the production branch, it's automatically deployed to production.

💡If you are only working with a main branch, you can still use GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process. These actions would be set to run when you push to the main branch. The downside is that you wouldn't have a test environment. This means that if something goes wrong, it's live on production before you can fix it. This is why it's recommended to have a test environment.

## 🛠️ GitHub Actions and Workflows

So then what are GitHub Actions? GitHub Actions are automated workflows (or your own personal robot butlers 🤖) that can be triggered by events, such as pushing code to a repository. They can be used to automate tasks like building and pushing Docker images, running tests, and deploying applications.

We will look at a few common workflows that can be automated with GitHub Actions.

- [ ] Code Quality Checks 🔍
- [ ] Build and Push Docker Images 🐳
- [ ] Unit Tests ✅ 

In order to create a workflow, you need to create a `.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. This should be in the root directory of your repository, if it doesn't exist, create it. The name of the file can be anything, but it's recommended to name it something that describes the workflow. For instance, if you're creating a workflow that runs unit tests, you could name it `tests.yml`.

- [Quickstart Quide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) ⚡

### 🎯 Code Quality Checks at the GitHub Repo Level

We have already looked at pre-commit hooks, which run code quality checks before each commit. GitHub Actions can be used to run these checks at the repo level. Pre-commit hooks are local to your machine, so if you're working on multiple machines, you'd have to set up the hooks on each machine. GitHub Actions are stored in the repository, so you don't have to worry about setting them up on each machine. These checks will run whenever someone pushes code to the repository.

This automation can ensure your code meets quality standards (like PEP8 in Python). For instance, you could have a workflow that runs `pylint` or `flake8` on each commit.

Example Workflow (`./github/workflows/lint.yml`):
```yaml
name: Python Lint Check
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.8
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install flake8
      - name: Run lint check
        run: |
          flake8 .
```
Let's break down this workflow:

- `name: Python Lint Check`: The `name` field is simply a name for your workflow. This name will be displayed in the Actions tab of your GitHub repository.

- `on: [push, pull_request]`: The `on` field is the event that triggers the workflow. In this case, the workflow is triggered whenever code is pushed to any branch of the repository (`push` event) or a pull request is made (`pull_request` event).

- `jobs:`: Jobs are the 'tasks' of your workflow. A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs. Jobs run in parallel by default. 

    - `lint:`: This is the id of the job. You can choose any name you like. 

    - `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`: This specifies the type of runner that the job will run on. The runner is a server that has the GitHub Actions runner application installed. You can use a runner hosted by GitHub (`ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, `macos-latest`), or host your own. 

    - `steps:`: Steps are a sequence of tasks that will be executed in the job.

        - `name: Check out code` and `uses: actions/checkout@v2`: This step checks-out your repository under `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, so your workflow can access it.

        - `name: Set up Python` and `uses: actions/setup-python@v2`: This step sets up the specified version of Python on the runner. The `with` keyword is used to pass input parameters to the action. Here, the `python-version: 3.8` parameter is used to specify the Python version.

        - `name: Install dependencies` and `run: | pip install flake8`: This step installs the required dependencies for the workflow. Here, it installs the `flake8` linting tool. 

        - `name: Run lint check` and `run: | flake8 .`: This is the final step, where the actual lint check is performed. `flake8 .` means run flake8 on all Python files in the current directory (recursively).

This workflow, therefore, sets up a Python environment, installs flake8, and then uses flake8 to perform a lint check on every push or pull request.

### 🐳 Build and Push Docker Images

If your project uses Docker, you can automate the process of building and pushing images. It ensures the Docker image is always synchronized with the latest code. So if you make changes to your code, you can push the changes to GitHub, and the Docker image will be automatically updated. This way you don't have to manually build and push the image each time you make changes.

Example Workflow (`./github/workflows/docker.yml`):
```yaml
name: Docker Build and Push
on: [push]
jobs:
  docker:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          {% raw %}
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}
          {% endraw %}
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        run: |
        {% raw %}
          docker build . -t your-dockerhub-username/your-repo:`$${{ github.sha }}`
          docker push your-dockerhub-username/your-repo:`$${{ github.sha }}`
        {% endraw %}
```
⚠️ Don't forget to add your DockerHub username and password as secrets in your repository. You can do this by going to the Settings tab of your repository, and then clicking on Secrets in the left sidebar. Click on New secret and add your DockerHub username and password.

⚠️⚠️ Don't forget to create a `.dockerignore` file to exclude files and directories from the Docker build context. For instance, you can exclude the `.git` directory, which is not required for the Docker image. If you have `.venv` or `docs` directories, or any other files or folders that aren't needed to run your application in the container you can exclude them as well.

Lets break down this workflow:

- `name: Docker Build and Push`: This is the name of your workflow and it is displayed in the GitHub Actions UI.

- `on: [push]`: This specifies the event that triggers the workflow. In this case, the workflow is initiated whenever code is pushed to any branch of the repository.

- `jobs:`: This section contains all the jobs that are part of this workflow.

    - `docker:`: This is the job id. You can choose any name you want.

    - `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`: This specifies the type of runner that the job will run on. This workflow uses the latest version of the GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runner.

    - `steps:`: This section lists all the steps that will be performed as part of this job.

        - `name: Check out code` and `uses: actions/checkout@v2`: This step checks-out your repository under `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, allowing the workflow to access the code.

        - `name: Login to DockerHub` and `uses: docker/login-action@v1`: This step uses the Docker login action to log into Docker Hub. The `with` keyword is used to pass input parameters to the action.

            - `username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}` and `password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}`: Here, the GitHub secrets `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD` are used to provide the Docker Hub username and password for the login. Secrets are encrypted environment variables that you create in a repository or organization, and they are only exposed to selected actions.
            To learn how to create secrets, see the GitHub documentation on [creating and using encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets).

        - `name: Build and push Docker image` and `run: |`: This step builds the Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub. 

            - `docker build . -t your-dockerhub-username/your-repo:${{ github.sha }}`: This command builds the Docker image. The `-t` option is used to name and optionally tag the image in the 'name:tag' format. `github.sha` is a predefined GitHub Actions variable for the commit SHA that triggered the workflow.

            - `docker push your-dockerhub-username/your-repo:${{ github.sha }}`: This command pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub.

This workflow, thus, checks out your code, logs into Docker Hub, builds a Docker image from your code, and pushes that image to Docker Hub, all triggered by a `push` event.

There is also a page in the Docker Hub documentation that explains how to use GitHub Actions to build and push images to Docker Hub.

### ✅ Unit Tests

Unit tests ensure every part of your code behaves as expected. You can create a workflow that runs unit tests on every push, catching bugs early. It's like having a safety net 🥅, catching bugs before they sneak into production.

Here's an example workflow for running tests with pytest on a Poetry-based project (`./github/workflows/tests.yml`):

```yaml
name: Python Unit Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.8

      - name: Install Poetry
        run: |
          curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python -

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          poetry install

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          poetry run pytest
```
Let's dissect this GitHub Actions workflow:

- `name: Python Unit Tests`: This is the name of your workflow. It's displayed in the GitHub Actions UI and makes it easy for you to identify different workflows in your repository.

- `on: [push, pull_request]`: This specifies the events that trigger this workflow. In this case, the workflow runs whenever code is pushed to the repository or a pull request is made.

- `jobs:`: This section contains all the jobs that are part of this workflow. In this case, we only have one job, `test`.

    - `test:`: This is the identifier for the job. You can choose any name you want.
    
    - `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`: This line specifies the type of runner that the job will run on. Here, it uses the latest version of the GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runner.

    - `steps:`: This section contains all the steps that are part of this job.

        - `name: Check out code` and `uses: actions/checkout@v2`: This step checks out your repository under `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, allowing your workflow to access your code.

        - `name: Set up Python` and `uses: actions/setup-python@v2`: This step sets up a Python environment in the runner. The `with` keyword is used to pass input parameters to the action. Here, it sets up Python version 3.8.

        - `name: Install Poetry` and `run: | curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python -`: This step installs Poetry on the runner. Poetry is a tool for Python dependency management.

        - `name: Install dependencies` and `run: | poetry install`: This step installs the Python dependencies specified in your `pyproject.toml` file, using Poetry.

        - `name: Run tests` and `run: | poetry run pytest`: This step runs your unit tests using pytest within the Poetry environment.

By using this workflow, your Python project with Poetry can automatically run unit tests on every `push` and `pull_request` event. This ensures that changes do not introduce bugs into the codebase, serving as a safety net to maintain the quality of your code.

## 🔄 Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

CI/CD ensures your Python project remains ready for production at all times. Continuous Integration involves regularly merging code changes, validating them through automated builds and tests. Continuous Deployment automates the release process, smoothly transferring validated updates to production.

In a Python project, for instance, your CI/CD pipeline could include steps for:

- Checking out code
- Setting up Python
- Installing dependencies
- Running lint checks
- Running unit tests
- Building Docker image
- Pushing Docker image to DockerHub
- Deploying updates to the server

Your CI/CD pipeline can be set up using GitHub Actions workflows like the examples provided above. This ensures the production-readiness of your project and significantly boosts the project's reliability.
