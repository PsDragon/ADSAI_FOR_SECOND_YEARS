# Azure Machine Learning Monitoring ðŸ‘€ (work in progress ðŸš§)

- [ ] Monitor deployed models using Azure Service Metrics and Azure Application Insights ðŸ“Š

## Should Monitor 2 main things Model Performance and Infrastructure Performance

Do a basic intro on why monitoring is important and then give links to azure resources. They can figure out the rest themselves.

Once your digit prediction model is up and running, predicting digits for users, you'll want to monitor its performance. This is where Azure's monitoring services come in.

---> monitoring endpoints
---> Advnaced: Azure Monitor stuff, custom metrics, monitor azure machine learning admin one
---> Advnaced data drift

**Monitoring with Azure Machine Learning**


- **Introduction to Monitoring in MLOps:** Explain the importance of monitoring for efficient and reliable model operation, touching upon various types of monitoring (system, data, model performance, etc).

- **How Azure Machine Learning supports Monitoring:** Overview of Azure Machine Learning's monitoring capabilities. Discuss how Azure ML allows monitoring of machine learning models, experiments, datasets and more.

- **Model Monitoring with Azure ML:** Deep-dive into monitoring machine learning models in production. Discuss how to set up monitoring, how to use metrics explorer in Azure ML Studio, how to capture and analyze metrics.

- **Real-time monitoring with Azure Machine Learning:** Discuss the concept of real-time monitoring, its benefits, and how it can be done using Azure ML. Include examples of real-time monitoring scenarios.

- **Introduction to Azure Application Insights:** Briefly introduce Azure Application Insights, its main features, and why it's useful for monitoring.

- **Integration of Azure ML and Azure Application Insights for Monitoring:** Discuss how Azure ML can be integrated with Azure Application Insights. Explain the steps to set up integration and what kind of data can be monitored.

- **Tracking Custom Events with Azure Application Insights:** Teach students how to track custom events in their ML models using Azure Application Insights, how to query the data, and how to set up alerts.

- **Real-time monitoring with Azure Application Insights:** Discuss how to use Azure Application Insights for real-time monitoring. Include examples of real-time monitoring scenarios and how to troubleshoot common issues.


- **Setting Up Azure Machine Learning for Monitoring:** Provide a step-by-step guide on how to set up Azure Machine Learning for monitoring. Include how to set up an Azure ML workspace, how to create a compute instance, and how to configure monitoring settings.

- **Monitoring Data Drift with Azure Machine Learning: A Step-by-step Tutorial:** Detailed walkthrough of how to set up and monitor data drift using Azure ML. Include how to create a Data Drift Detector, how to configure it, and how to interpret the results.

- **Hands-On: Integrating Azure ML and Azure Application Insights for Enhanced Monitoring:** Provide a detailed guide on how to integrate Azure ML and Azure Application Insights. Include how to configure the integration, how to track custom events, and how to set up alerts.

- **Exercise: Create Your Own Monitoring Solution:** Ask students to create their own monitoring solution using Azure ML and Azure Application Insights. They should be able to set up the integration, track custom events, set up alerts, and interpret the results. Provide a sample solution for students to reference if they get stuck.



## Azure Service Metrics

Azure Service Metrics offer an overview of your deployed model's performance, including metrics like the number of requests your model is handling, and the response time for these requests.

## Azure Application Insights

Azure Application Insights offers deeper insight into your deployed models, providing data on request rates, response times, failure rates, and more.

## Log Analytics

Azure Log Analytics offers even deeper insight into your deployed models, providing data on request rates, response times, failure rates, and more.

## Alerts

Azure Alerts allow you to set up alerts for your deployed models, so that you can be notified when something goes wrong.

## Deployment Scaling

Azure Deployment Scaling allows you to scale your deployed models up or down, depending on the demand for your model.
