# Azure Machine Learning Monitoring 👀 (work in progress 🚧)

Monitoring deployed machine learning models is an integral part of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps). Think of it as keeping track of your model's "health." 🩺👩‍⚕️ Just like how we have regular check-ups to maintain our health, machine learning models need regular check-ups too. In this module we well explore the why and how of monitoring machine learning models in production.

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- [ ] Understand the importance of monitoring machine learning models in production.
- [ ] Monitor machine learning models using Azure Machine Learning.
- [ ] Monitor machine learning models using Azure Application Insights.
- [ ] Monitor machine learning models using Azure Monitor.

## Why Monitor Machine Learning Models?

As mentioned above, machine learning models are not "set it and forget it" tools. 🔄 They need to be monitored to ensure they continue to perform well over time. This is especially important for models that are deployed in production. Here are some reasons why:

- 1️⃣ **Model Performance Decay**: ML models aren't "set it and forget it" tools. 🔄 Over time, the data they were trained on may no longer be relevant, causing the model's performance to decay. Imagine a model trained to predict fashion trends based on data from 2010. If it's 2023, the model might suggest that we all start wearing Ugg boots and trucker hats again! 🤷‍♂️👢🧢 Fashion has changed, so the model's predictions are out of date.

- 2️⃣ **Data Drift**: Sometimes, the input data changes over time. This change is known as "data drift." For instance, suppose you've developed an ML model to predict the price of avocados 🥑 based on features like season, region, and demand. If the factors influencing the price change (like a sudden avocado craze), the model might start to predict inaccurate results.

- 3️⃣ **Concept Drift**: Similar to data drift, the underlying patterns that the model learned can change over time, causing a phenomenon called "concept drift." Let's say you trained a model to predict popular baby names. 👶 If a new celebrity emerges with a unique name, the pattern of what constitutes a "popular name" might change!

- 4️⃣ **Unexpected Errors**: Unexpected events can cause errors in your model's performance. 😲 Let's say you're running a movie recommendation model and a new film gets released. If there's a bug in the way new films are added to your database, your model might not handle it correctly.

So, how do we monitor these models to ensure they stay in top shape? Here's what you should keep an eye on:

- 🅰️ **Model Performance Metrics**: These include measures like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Area Under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) for classification tasks, or Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for regression tasks. If these start to fall, your model might be getting "sick." 🌡️ 

- 🅱️ **Input Data Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the features that your model is receiving as inputs. Are these inputs changing over time (data drift)? Are they outside the range your model was trained on (outliers)? 📊📈

- 🅲️ **Output Data Monitoring**: Monitor the predictions your model is making. Are there sudden changes? Are you seeing an increase in a certain type of prediction? Are the predictions becoming less confident? 📉🔍

- 🅳️ **System Metrics**: These include metrics like prediction latency (how long it takes to make a prediction), throughput (how many predictions can be made in a given time), memory usage, and CPU usage. 🖥️⏳ If these start to spike, there could be a problem with your system!

To summarize, monitoring your deployed machine learning models is vital to ensure they continue to perform well over time. As a data scientist or machine learning engineer, you should be keeping an eye on both your model's health and the health of the system it's running on. 🏥👀 Always remember, a model is only as good as its latest check-up! 🌟

## 3. Monitoring Data Drift 📊📈

Data drift is a phenomenon that occurs when the input data to a model changes over time. This change can cause the model's performance to degrade. For example, suppose you've developed an ML model to predict the price of avocados 🥑 based on features like season, region, and demand. If the factors influencing the price change (like a sudden avocado craze), the model might start to predict inaccurate results.
