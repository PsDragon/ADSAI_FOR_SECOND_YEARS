# Azure Machine Learning Monitoring ðŸ‘€ (work in progress ðŸš§)

- [ ] Monitor deployed models using Azure Service Metrics and Azure Application Insights ðŸ“Š

Once your digit prediction model is up and running, predicting digits for users, you'll want to monitor its performance. This is where Azure's monitoring services come in.

## Azure Service Metrics

Azure Service Metrics offer an overview of your deployed model's performance, including metrics like the number of requests your model is handling, and the response time for these requests.

## Azure Application Insights

Azure Application Insights offers deeper insight into your deployed models, providing data on request rates, response times, failure rates, and more.

## Log Analytics

Azure Log Analytics offers even deeper insight into your deployed models, providing data on request rates, response times, failure rates, and more.

## Alerts

Azure Alerts allow you to set up alerts for your deployed models, so that you can be notified when something goes wrong.

## Deployment Scaling

Azure Deployment Scaling allows you to scale your deployed models up or down, depending on the demand for your model.
