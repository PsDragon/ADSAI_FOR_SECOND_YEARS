# Interfacing with Python Packages - CLIs

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to this module on interacting with Python code using Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)! 🐍 In this module, we'll dive into why you might want to use these tools to interact with a codebase instead of editing the code directly, and explore some popular Python libraries that can help you build powerful CLIs. 

After completing this course, you will be able to:

- [ ] **Create** powerful and user-friendly command line interfaces (CLIs) using popular Python libraries like `argparse` and `Typer`.
- [ ] **Test** and **deploy** your CLIs to ensure their correctness, robustness, and seamless integration with other applications and systems.
- [ ] **Apply** best practices for building maintainable, scalable, and user-friendly interfaces in your Python projects.

Let's get started! 😄

### 1.1. Why use CLIs and APIs? 🤔

You might be wondering why we'd want to interact with Python code using CLIs and APIs instead of just editing the code. Great question! Here are a few reasons:

1. **Ease of use**: CLIs and APIs provide a simpler, more consistent way to interact with your code. You don't need to dive into the codebase to make changes – just send a command or a request! 🚀 Think of CLIs and APIs like a remote control for your code. You don't need to open up the TV and tinker with its components to change channels or adjust the volume. Instead, you just press a button on the remote and voilà! Similarly, CLIs and APIs allow you to interact with your code by sending commands or requests, without diving into the codebase. 🚀📺

2. **Encapsulation**: These tools help you separate the functionality of your code from its interface. This makes it easier to maintain, update, and extend your code. 👌 Imagine a car engine – you don't need to understand every detail of its complex internal workings to drive the car. You only need to know how to use the steering wheel, pedals, and other controls. CLIs and APIs work like the car's controls, encapsulating the complexity of your code and providing a simplified interface that makes it easier to maintain, update, and extend your code. 🚗🔧

3. **Collaboration**: By providing a clear interface, CLIs and APIs make it easier for others to interact with your code without having to understand all its inner workings. 🤝 Picture a restaurant kitchen. The chef doesn't need to know how to grow and harvest the ingredients; they just need to know how to cook them. CLIs and APIs are like a recipe that other developers can follow to use your code, without having to understand all its inner workings. This makes it easier for others to work with your code, creating a more collaborative environment. 👩‍🍳📖

4. **Integration**: APIs, in particular, enable you to expose your code's functionality so that it can be easily consumed by other applications, services, or systems. 🌐 Imagine your code as a power outlet, and APIs as the adapter that lets you plug in various devices from around the world. By exposing your code's functionality through APIs, you make it easy for other applications, services, or systems to "plug in" and consume your code, just like an adapter lets you connect a foreign device to a local power source. This enables seamless integration and communication between different systems. 🔌🌐 We will cover APIs in more detail in a future learning module.

Now that we know *why* we'd want to use these tools, let's take a look at some popular Python libraries for building CLIs!

### 1.2. CLI Libraries: argparse vs. Typer 🛠️

There are many libraries available for creating CLIs in Python, but two of the most popular are `argparse` and `Typer`. You will already have come across `argparse`, but `Typer` may be new.  Let's take a look at their key features and differences:

| Feature                | argparse ([docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html))                                            | Typer ([docs](https://typer.tiangolo.com/))                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Included in Python     | Yes, it's part of the standard library! 🎁          | No, you'll need to install it. 📦     |
| Syntax                 | More verbose, with lots of boilerplate code. 😵     | Minimal and clean. 😇                 |
| Type annotations       | Not supported.                                      | Supported! 🎉                          |
| Automatic help         | Yes, but customization is limited. 🆘                | Yes, and it's highly customizable! 💪  |
| Tab completion         | Not supported out of the box. 😕                    | Yes, with just a few lines of code! 🤯 |

In summary, while `argparse` is part of the standard library and doesn't require installation, `Typer` is a more modern and user-friendly option that supports type annotations and offers a cleaner syntax. You are welcome to use either library for your projects.

### 1.3. What is a Command Line Interface (CLI)? 🤔

A Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a program or an operating system by entering commands and receiving textual responses. CLIs are a powerful way to access a program's functionality without the need for a graphical user interface (GUI). They're especially popular among developers, as they offer a more direct and flexible way to interact with software.

### 1.4. Why Use CLIs Specifically? 💡

There are several reasons why you might choose to create a CLI specifically for your Python code:

1. **Simplicity**: CLIs can be simpler and faster to use than GUIs for certain tasks, especially when users are familiar with the commands.
2. **Scriptability**: CLIs make it easy to automate tasks using scripts, enabling users to perform repetitive tasks more efficiently.
3. **Low resource usage**: CLIs generally require fewer system resources than GUIs, making them ideal for running on low-powered devices or remote servers.
4. **Cross-platform compatibility**: CLIs can run on a variety of platforms without the need for platform-specific UI elements.

## 2. Building CLIs with Python 🐍

### 2.1. Argparse: The Standard Library CLI Library 📚

Argparse, is a powerful CLI library that's part of Python's standard library! In this section, we'll explore the building blocks of argparse and learn how to create more complex argument structures and customize help messages. Let's dive in! 🏊‍♂️

#### Building Blocks of argparse 🧱

`argparse`  provides several key components that allow you to create flexible and powerful CLIs:

1. __ArgumentParser__: The main class that you'll use to create a CLI. It's responsible for parsing the command line arguments and generating help messages.

2. __add_argument__: A method of the ArgumentParser class that lets you define new command line arguments, along with their types, choices, and help messages.

3. __parse_args__: A method of the ArgumentParser class that parses the command line arguments and returns an object with the values of the defined arguments.

4. __Argument Groups and Subparsers__: Advanced features that allow you to create more organized and modular CLIs.

Now that we're familiar with the building blocks, let's see how we can use them to create a CLI.

#### Creating a Simple CLI with `argparse` 🛠️

Let's build our first CLI using Python's built-in `argparse` library. This simple CLI will perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

```python
import argparse

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="A simple calculator CLI")
    parser.add_argument("x", type=float, help="First number")
    parser.add_argument("y", type=float, help="Second number")
    parser.add_argument("operation", choices=["add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide"], help="Arithmetic operation")

    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.operation == "add":
        result = args.x + args.y
    elif args.operation == "subtract":
        result = args.x - args.y
    elif args.operation == "multiply":
        result = args.x * args.y
    else:
        result = args.x / args.y

    print(f"Result: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

:pencil: __2.1a__ Save the code as `calculator.py` and run it in the terminal with the following command:

```bash
python calculator.py 5 3 add
```

You should see the output: `Result: 8.0`

Congratulations, you've just created your first CLI using `argparse`! 🎉

#### Adding Help Messages 🆘

One of the most useful features of `argparse` is its ability to automatically generate help messages for your CLI. To enable this feature, you'll need to add a `--help` argument to your CLI. Let's see how this works:

:pencil: __2.1b__ Add the following code to the end of your `calculator.py` file:

```python
parser.add_argument("--help", action="help", help="Show this help message and exit")
```

Now run the CLI again with the `--help` argument:

```bash
python calculator.py --help
```

For more information on the `argparse` library, check out the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html).

### 2.2. Typer: A Modern CLI Library 🌟

`Typer` is a powerful and modern CLI library built on top of `Click`! In this section, we'll explore the key features of `Typer`, learn how to create CLIs with subcommands, and discover some advanced features like automatic completion and dynamic output formatting. Let's dive in! 🏊‍♂️

#### Key Features of Typer 🌟

`Typer` offers several advantages over traditional CLI libraries like `argparse`:

1. **Type hints**: `Typer` uses Python's type hints to automatically convert and validate command line arguments.

2. **Subcommands**: Easily create nested subcommands using functions, making your CLI more modular and maintainable.

3. **Automatic completion**: `Typer` automatically generates shell completion scripts for your CLI, making it even more user-friendly.

4. **Dynamic output formatting**: Customize your CLI's output based on the user's preferences or the context of the command.

Now that we're familiar with the key features, let's see how we can use them to create a CLI.

#### Creating a Simple CLI with `Typer` 💎

To get started, you'll need to install Typer:

```bash
pip install typer
```

Let's create the same calculator CLI we built earlier, but this time using `Typer`:

```python
import typer

app = typer.Typer()

@app.command()
def calculator(x: float, y: float, operation: str = typer.Option(..., help="Arithmetic operation", case_sensitive=False, choices=["add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide"])):
    if operation.lower() == "add":
        result = x + y
    elif operation.lower() == "subtract":
        result = x - y
    elif operation.lower() == "multiply":
        result = x * y
    elif operation.lower() == "divide":
        result = x / y

    typer.echo(f"Result: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
```

:pencil: __2.2a__ Save the code as `calculator_typer.py` and run it in the terminal with the following command:

```bash
python calculator_typer.py calculator 5 3 add
```

You should see the output: `Result: 8.0`

Great job, you've just built a CLI using `Typer`! 🎊

As you can see, `Typer` offers a cleaner syntax and supports type annotations, making it easier to create more advanced and user-friendly CLIs.

#### Advanced Features 🚀

`Typer` offers several advanced features that can make your CLI even more powerful and user-friendly:

-  Automatic Completion 📝

`Typer` can automatically generate shell completion scripts for your CLI, making it easier for users to discover and use available commands and options. To enable completion, simply add the `--install-completion` option when running your CLI:

```bash
python calculator_typer.py --install-completion
```

This will install the completion script for your current shell. To see the completion script without installing it, use the `--show-completion` option:

```bash
python calculator_typer.py --show-completion
```

- Dynamic Output Formatting 🎨

`Typer` allows you to customize your CLI's output based on the user's preferences or the context of the command. For example, you can use the `--verbose` option to control the level of detail in the output. You can also use the `--style` option to change the output style:

```python
import typer

app = typer.Typer()

@app.command()
def calculator(x: float, y: float, operation: str = typer.Option(..., help="Arithmetic operation", case_sensitive=False, choices=["add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide"]),
               verbose: bool = typer.Option(False, help="Display verbose output")):
    if operation.lower() == "add":
        result = x + y
        op_symbol = "+"
    elif operation.lower() == "subtract":
        result = x - y
        op_symbol = "-"
    elif operation.lower() == "multiply":
        result = x * y
        op_symbol = "*"
    elif operation.lower() == "divide":
        result = x / y
        op_symbol = "/"

    styled_operation = typer.style(operation.capitalize(), fg=typer.colors.BRIGHT_BLUE, bold=True)
    styled_result = typer.style(f"{result:.2f}", fg=typer.colors.GREEN, bold=True)

    if verbose:
        typer.echo(f"Performing {styled_operation} operation:")
        typer.echo(f"{x} {op_symbol} {y} = {styled_result}")
    else:
        typer.echo(f"Result: {styled_result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
```

In this updated version, we've added a `verbose` option using `typer.Option`, which defaults to `False`. If `verbose` is set to `True`, the CLI will display additional information about the operation being performed. We've also used `typer.style` to apply colors and bold text to the operation and result. The `fg` parameter sets the text color, and `bold=True` makes the text bold. We've also added an `op_symbol` variable to store the appropriate arithmetic symbol for each operation.

When you run the CLI, the output will be styled with the specified colors and bold text.

Here's an example of running the CLI with the `--verbose` option:

```bash
python calculator.py 5 3 --operation add --verbose
```

Output:

```
Performing Add operation:
5 + 3 = 8.00
```

Without the `--verbose` option, the output remains the same as before:

```bash
python calculator.py 5 3 --operation add
```

Output:

```
Result: 8.00
```
