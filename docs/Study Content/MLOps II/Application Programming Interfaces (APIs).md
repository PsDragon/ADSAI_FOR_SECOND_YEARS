# Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) (ðŸš§ Work in progress)

- [ ] **Design** and implement APIs with `FastAPI`, incorporating input validation, security, authentication, and authorization.

### 1.3. API Library: FastAPI ðŸš€

`FastAPI` ([docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/))is a popular Python library for building APIs. It's known for its speed, ease of use, and automatic documentation generation. Some of its key features include:

- **Type annotations**: FastAPI uses Python type hints to validate input data, generate documentation, and provide IDE autocompletion.
- **Speed**: Built on top of Starlette and Pydantic, FastAPI is one of the fastest Python web frameworks available.
- **Automatic documentation**: FastAPI generates interactive API documentation (using OpenAPI and JSON Schema) right out of the box, making it easy for developers to understand and test your API. ðŸ“š
