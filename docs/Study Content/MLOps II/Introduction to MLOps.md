## What is Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)?

MLOps, short for Machine Learning Operations, is the practice of combining Machine Learning, DevOps, and Data Engineering to facilitate the development, deployment, and monitoring of ML models in production. MLOps is a set of practices that enables you to manage the entire lifecycle of machine learning models. It aims to streamline the end-to-end process of building, deploying, and maintaining ML models by automating tasks, improving collaboration between teams, and promoting the reusability of components.

MLOps is a relatively new field, and it is still evolving. However, it is becoming increasingly important as more organizations adopt machine learning. MLOps is a key component of the machine learning lifecycle, and it is essential for building and deploying machine learning models at scale.

To better understand the importance of MLOps, watch the following video:
