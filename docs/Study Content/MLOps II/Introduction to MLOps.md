# What is Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)?

MLOps is the practice of applying DevOps principles to machine learning (ML) development. MLOps is a set of practices that enables you to manage the entire lifecycle of machine learning models. It is a combination of software engineering and machine learning practices that enables you to build, test, deploy, and monitor machine learning models in production.

MLOps is a relatively new field, and it is still evolving. However, it is becoming increasingly important as more organizations adopt machine learning. MLOps is a key component of the machine learning lifecycle, and it is essential for building and deploying machine learning models at scale.
