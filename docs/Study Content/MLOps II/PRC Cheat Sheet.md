# 🌟 Welcome, future Python wizards! 🌟

Ready to level up your Python skills? Let's dive into a magical cheat sheet for best practices and code refactoring, sprinkled with MNIST examples for training and inferencing. 🧙‍♂️

1. 📚 Import your trusty spellbooks (libraries) 📚

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
```

2. 🧹 Keep your spellcasting room tidy (code structure) 🧹

Organize your code using functions, classes, and modules to make it easier to maintain and understand. Here's an example:

```python
def load_mnist_data():
    # Load your data here
    pass

def preprocess_mnist_data(data):
    # Preprocess your data here
    pass

def build_mnist_model():
    # Build your model here
    pass

def train_mnist_model(model, data, labels):
    # Train your model here
    pass

def evaluate_mnist_model(model, data, labels):
    # Evaluate your model here
    pass

def main():
    # Call your functions in the right order
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

3. 📏 Stick to the sacred scrolls (PEP 8) 📏

PEP 8 is the style guide for Python code. Follow its wisdom to make your code readable and maintainable.

4. 🎁 Give and receive gifts (function arguments) 🎁

Use function arguments and return values instead of global variables. This makes your functions more flexible and easier to test.

```python
def train_mnist_model(data, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32):
    # Train your model here
    pass
```

5. 📝 Describe your spells (docstrings) 📝

Add docstrings to your functions to explain what they do, the parameters they take, and the values they return.

```python
def train_mnist_model(data, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32):
    """
    Train the MNIST model.

    Args:
        data (np.array): The training data.
        labels (np.array): The training labels.
        epochs (int, optional): Number of training epochs. Defaults to 10.
        batch_size (int, optional): Size of the training batch. Defaults to 32.

    Returns:
        tf.keras.Model: The trained model.
    """
    pass
```

6. 🔄 DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself 🔄

If you see similar code in multiple places, refactor it into a separate function or class.

7. 🔮 See the future (type hints) 🔮

Add type hints to your functions for better readability and to catch potential bugs early.

```python
from typing import Tuple

def load_mnist_data() -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    # Load your data here
    pass
```

8. 🚀 Turbocharge your broom (performance) 🚀

Refactor your code for better performance. Use NumPy, pandas, and other libraries for heavy calculations. Use the power of GPUs with TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning.

9. 🌟 Let there be light (testing) 🌟

Use unit tests and assertions to ensure that your code works as expected. This helps catch bugs before they become disasters.

```python
def test_preprocess_mnist_data():
    dummy_data = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28)
    preprocessed_data = preprocess_mnist_data(dummy_data)
    assert preprocessed_data.shape == (1, 28, 28, 1), "Preprocessed data has the wrong shape!"

def test_build_mnist_model():
    model = build_mnist_model()
    assert isinstance(model, tf.keras.Model), "Model is not a Keras model!"

def test_train_mnist_model():
    # Prepare dummy data and labels
    dummy_data = np.random.rand(10, 28, 28, 1)
    dummy_labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(10,))

    # Train the model with the dummy data
    model = build_mnist_model()
    trained_model = train_mnist_model(model, dummy_data, dummy_labels)

    # Check if the model is still a Keras model after training
    assert isinstance(trained_model, tf.keras.Model), "Trained model is not a Keras model!"

def test_evaluate_mnist_model():
    # Prepare dummy data and labels
    dummy_data = np.random.rand(10, 28, 28, 1)
    dummy_labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(10,))

    # Train and evaluate the model with the dummy data
    model = build_mnist_model()
    trained_model = train_mnist_model(model, dummy_data, dummy_labels)
    accuracy = evaluate_mnist_model(trained_model, dummy_data, dummy_labels)

    # Check if the returned accuracy is a float
    assert isinstance(accuracy, float), "Accuracy is not a float!"

def main():
    # Call your functions in the right order
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    # Run the tests
    test_preprocess_mnist_data()
    test_build_mnist_model()
    test_train_mnist_model()
    test_evaluate_mnist_model()
```
