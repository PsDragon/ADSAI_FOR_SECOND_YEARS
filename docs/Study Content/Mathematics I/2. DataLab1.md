# 1. Data Lab 1: Elementary Operations on Matrices

In this module, you will be introduced to some fundamental concepts in linear algebra
that form the foundation of many data science and AI models you will encounter
as you progress through your study program. Rather than teach it as a core mathematical
topic, the aim of this module is to provide you with exposure to key topics in linear
algebra that are essential for data science.

## Today's learning objectives
- [ ] Understand how to compute the determinant of a matrix.
- [ ] Understand how to transpose a matrix.
- [ ] Understand how to compute the inverse of a matrix.
