# 1. Elementary Operations on Matrices

In this module, you will be introduced to some elementary operation on
scalars, vectors and matrices that are key linear algebra.

## Today's learning objectives
- [ ] Understand matrix transpose
- [ ] Understand matrix inverse.
- [ ] Understand special matrices - diagonal, identity, and symmetric, orthagonal.

## Transpose of a Matrix

One important operation on matrices is the transpose. The transpose of a
matrix is the mirror image of the matrix across a diagonal line, called the main
diagonal, running down from the top left and to the bottom right.
<br>
> We denote the transpose of a matrix A as A<sup>T</sup>.
