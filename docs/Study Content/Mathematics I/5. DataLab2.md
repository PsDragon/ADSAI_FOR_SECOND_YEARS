# Data Lab 2: Creative Brief

Write a Python function to estimate the coefficients of a linear regression model using the normal equations.

&beta; = (X<sup>T</sup>X)<sup>-1</sup>X<sup>T</sup>Y

Where,

&beta; : vector of regression coefficients <br>
X : matrix of predictor variables. <br>
Y : vector of the outcome variable. <br>


## Requirements

Create functions in Python [1, 2] to:

1. Calculate the determinant of a matrix.
2. Obtain the transpose of a matrix.
3. Perform matrix inversion.
4. Compute the product of two matrices.

## Deliverable(s)

The Jupyter notebooks or .py scripts are to be uploaded to Github no later than 5pm on last data lab day. Confer with a lecturer beforehand if you're handing in something other than Jupyter notebook or .py scripts.
