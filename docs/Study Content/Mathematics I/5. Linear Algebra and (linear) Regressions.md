# 1. Linear Algebra and Linear Regressions: an affair that's meant to last!

In this module, you will be introduced to some fundamental concepts in linear algebra
that form the foundation of many data science and AI models you will encounter
as you progress through your study program. Rather than teach it as a core mathematical
topic, the aim of this module is to provide you with exposure to key topics in linear
algebra that are essential for data science.

## Today's learning objectives
- [ ] Understand the relationship between linear algebrea and linear models.
- [ ] Understand the notion of linear independence.
- [ ] Familiarise yourself with the normal equations to solve linear models.
