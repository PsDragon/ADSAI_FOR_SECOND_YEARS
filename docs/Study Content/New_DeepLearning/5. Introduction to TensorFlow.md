# Implementing Neural networks using TensorFlow

The goal for today is to take the abstract concepts about neural networks you have learned and translate them using TensorFlow. In this section, you will find code your own neural network and investigate ways to fine-tune your program with hyperparameter.

## Learning Objective:

1. Design a neural network from scratch using Tensorflow
2. Use deep learning models to solve regression problems
3. Tune the hyperparameters of your model and improve its performance through iterative testing


## Implementing Neural Networks

For today, follow the best course available on implementing Neural Network using tensorflow. 

You should follow the course and make notes of things you are learning in your own words in your **_DL-notes.docx_** file in your **_Block C Microsoft Teams assignment_**.

 Also, if you are using notebook other than Codecademy session, make sure you upload them to your Block C Github repository.
