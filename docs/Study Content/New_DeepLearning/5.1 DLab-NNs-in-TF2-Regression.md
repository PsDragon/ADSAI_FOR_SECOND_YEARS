# Data Lab 5: Neural Network in Tensorflow

Continuing yesterday's codecademy course on implementing fully connected neural network, today you will be working on the codecademy projects on the same subject.

## 1. Assignment 1:

design, train, and evaluate a neural network model performing the task of regression to predict the life expectancy of countries

Codecademy Project : [Life Expectancy](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-deep-learning-models-with-tensorflow/tracks/dlsp-getting-started-with-tensorflow/modules/dlsp-implementing-neural-networks/projects/implementing-neural-networks-project)


```tip
 **Pro Tip !!**
 
 
 Take notes of what new concepts are being discussed. You can take notes in the **_DL-notes.docx_** file in your **_Block C Microsoft Teams assignment_**. This notes document is automatically part of your evidence for assessment.
```

## Assignment 2:

For this assignment submit your google colab notebook as _**DL-Codecademy-AdmissionAnalysis.ipynb**_ or python script from Codecademy session as _**DL-Codecademy-AdmissionAnalysis.py**_ in Block C Github repository.
