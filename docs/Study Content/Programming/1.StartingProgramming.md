# 1. Programming: A Primer

Becoming a data scientist without learning how to program is similar to becoming
an architect without learning how to draw. You will develop a concept design,
but have no means of implementing and sharing it.

While the modules in Data Science and AI will develop your mathematics and statistics knowledge,
this module will focus on developing your **hacking i.e. programming** skills.

## Today's learning objectives
- [ ] Understand what is an algorithm.
- [ ] Understand flowcharts and psuedocodes.
- [ ] Develop an intuition for computation thinking.

### Algorithm
A computer program or algorithm is a setp by step set of instructions which are designed to accomplish a specific outcome. However, the process of writing an optimal computer program involves a lot more than writing code. Designing algorithms and flowcharts to document the process flow, profiling the algorithms' accuracy, documentation and testing are all part of the process of computer programming. Algorithms are typically represented using psuedocodes- an english like syntax that resembles a programming language.

### Flowcharts
One of the key skills you will gain if you succesfully complete this module is computational thinking. The first step towards acquiring this skill is being able to design your algorithm and flow of logic. This is typically done by drawing a flowchart. A flowchart allows you to break down a complex problem into simpler blocks which are then connected to create a computer program. Please watch this video for a brief introduction to a flowchart.

As you may have noticed in the video, a flowchart consists of certain elements.

Process start and end nodes (times when the project starts or ends), project development stages (activities to be carried out), decision nodes (times when a decision needs to be made) and connectors (arrows indicating the project time flow). In the industry, Microsoft Visio is typically used to draw flowcharts, for this module you are free to use any software you prefer (e.g., PowerPoint), or even draw a flowchart by hand.

### Computational thinking

Computation thinking refers to the process of breaking down a complex task into
a set of easy-to-solve simple tasks. Whether you chose to become an AI expert,
data scientist or engineer, AI consultant, or a coach - you will require computational thinking.
This is typically done by:

1. Decomposition: break down a complex problem into simpler parts.
2. Pattern recognition: look for similarities between parts
3. Abstraction: focus on relevant information and ignore details not relevant to the problem.
4. Algorithm: develop step-by-step rules to help solve the problem.


Please watch the video below to understand more about computational thinking.

> Look up **exact instructions** on youtube for similar content! It's a good lesson
in computational thinking.

## Assignment

**2** In the DataLab session for Data Science, you followed a sequence of steps in order to develop your creative brief, the Poster-Our World in Data. Represent the steps you took using a flowchart.

**3** Develop an algorithm to find the largest of 3 numbers a, b, c. Use psuedocode and a flowchart to design your algorithm.

**4** Using computational thinking, write down a set of 'exact instructions' on
how to cook pasta pesto.
