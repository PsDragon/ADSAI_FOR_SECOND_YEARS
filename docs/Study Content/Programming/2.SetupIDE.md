# Setting up your local AI and Data Science environment - Installing Anaconda
Before you start building AI and Data Science applications, you will need to install Python on your computer.
An easy way to install Python on your computer is using **Anaconda** [[2](#2)]. Anaconda is a free python package manager that is geared towards AI and Data Science. In simple terms, installing Anaconda not only installs the latest version of Python, but also installs common python libraries that are used by Data Scientists in the industry. Please watch the below tutorial on how to install Anaconda on your computer. Alternatively, goto <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual> and follow the instructions.

## Jupyter notebooks
The Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that you can use to create and share documents (or notebooks) that can contain  interactive code, documentation, visualizations, and text. By default, when you install Anaconda, jupyter notebook is also installed.

Please watch the following video to learn more about Jupyter Notebooks.

To launch Jupyter Notebook, please open the Anaconda Navigator application. You will observe that Jupyter notebook is indeed installed.

## Github
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere [[3]](#3). Please watch the video below to become familiar with Github.

## Working in the cloud!

Please note that the previous instructions are with reference to setting up your local development environment for Data Science and AI. While the focus of this block is to become comfortable working on your local dev. env., in some projects for the rest of the programme, it becomes, for various reasons, more handy to switch to the cloud.

One of the key cloud-based environments for Data Science and AI is - **Google Colab**.
In simple terms, it helps to view colab as a jupyter notebook hosted on a remote Google server, with access to a GPU.
To learn more about Colab, please watch the following video.

> We will almost exclusively work with Colab in Block C, but for now, on your local environment must you work as you will be working with sensitive data that we do not wish to upload onto Google Cloud (drive).
