# 2. Setting up your development environment

## Today's learning objectives

- [ ] Install Python using Anaconda.
- [ ] Setup and become familiar with VS Code.
- [ ] Setup and become familiar with Jupyter Notebooks.
- [ ] Setup and become familiar with Github.


## Setting up your local AI and Data Science environment - Installing Anaconda

Before you start building AI and Data Science applications, you will need to install Python on your computer.
An easy way to install Python on your computer is using **Anaconda**. Anaconda is a free python package manager that is geared towards AI and Data Science. In simple terms, installing Anaconda not only installs the latest version of Python, but also installs common python libraries that are used by Data Scientists in the industry. Please watch the below tutorial on how to install Anaconda on your computer. Alternatively, goto <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual> and follow the instructions provided.

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages such as Python.

Here's a video introducing the key features of VS Code.

## Jupyter notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks are an open source web application that you can use to create and share documents (or notebooks) that can contain  interactive code, documentation, visualizations, and text. By default, when you install Anaconda, jupyter notebook is also installed. Furthermore, VS Code can be used to veloped python apps using Jupyter. To learn more about Jupyter, Python and VS Code, please watch the following video.

## Github

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. Please watch the video below to become familiar with Github.

## Working in the cloud

Please note that the previous instructions are with reference to setting up your local development environment for Data Science and AI. While the focus of this block is to become comfortable working on your local dev. env., in some projects for the rest of the programme, it becomes, for various reasons, more handy to switch to the cloud.

### Github Codespaces

A Github codespace is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud. Please watch the following video to learn more about Codespaces.

GitHub Codespaces provides cloud-powered development environments for any data science activity and you can work with these environments from Visual Studio Code or in a browser-based editor.

### Google Colab

One of the key cloud-based environments for Data Science and AI is - **Google Colab**.
In simple terms, it helps to view colab as a jupyter notebook hosted on a remote Google server, with access to a GPU.
To learn more about Colab, please watch the following video.

> We will almost exclusively work with Colab in Block C, but for now, on your local environment must you work as you will be working with sensitive data that we do not wish to upload onto Google Cloud (drive).

## Assignment

- [ ] Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual){:target="_blank"}.

- [ ] Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"}.

- [ ] Enable Python and Jupyter in VS Code. [clicky](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/overview){:target="_blank"}.

- [ ] To get started with Jupyter Notebook in VS Code, please follow the instructions you can find [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks){:target="_blank"}.

- [ ] To ensure that everything is setup and error free, please follow the instructions you see [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/data-science-tutorial){:target="_blank"} and commit your notebooks to your Github repositories with the name formatted as **lastname_firstname_PythonIDESetup.ipynb**.

> <mark>Do not worry if you do not understand what the code is doing, the focus of this assignment is simply to copy-paste code and ensure that everything works. The workflow you observe here concerning machine learning and data processing will be something you will revisit in the later weeks of this block.</mark>

- [ ] Optional: Please complete the course **Introduction to Github** by clicking [here](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github){:target="_blank"}. 


<mark> These assignments do not count towards your final grade.
<br>
However, note that the *Github Repository* and *Github Pages* webpage you develop as part of this assignment can be used to showcase your DataScience and AI [Portfolio](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/how-to-build-a-great-data-science-portfolio-with-examples) as you progress through the study program.</mark>

**Enjoy the rest of your break and see you in Block B!**
