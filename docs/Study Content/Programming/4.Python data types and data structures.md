# Python data types & data structures

We discovered earlier this week that an important characteristic of Python
is that every variable exists in the Python interpreter in its own container which is referred
to as a Python object. Further, variables in Python can store data of several types.

The most commonly used data types in Python which we will explore today are:

Variable type | Python data types
------------  | -----------------
Text          | ```str```
Numeric       | ```int```,  ```float```,  ```complex```
Sequence      | ```list```,  ```tuple```
Map           | ```dict```
Set           | ```set```
Boolean       | ```bool```

## Today's learning objectives

- [ ] Understand basic data types in Python (num, string)
- [ ] Understand collections in Python (lists, tuples, dict)
- [ ] Understand common operations and methods on Python data types (e.g., list comprehension)

## Getting and setting data types

To get the data type of any Python variable, we use the ```type()``` function.

```python
x = 10
datatypeofx = type(x)
print(datatypeofx)
```

To set the data type of any Python variable, we do not need to use an explicit function.
Python is commonly termed a **dynamically typed language**. What this implies is
that the data type of the variable is not set during variable assignment, but rather
determined when an operation is performed on the variable.

For example, try to analyse the following code snippet.

```python
x = 'Hello World'
y = ', how u doin?'
z = x + y
print(z)
print('Data type of z: ', type(z))
```

Now, try this out:

```python
x = 4
y = 5
z = x + y
print(z)
print('Data type of z: ', type(z))
```

As you will notice, Python automatically detects the data types of ```x``` and ```y```,
which further determines the data type of ```z```. Now, what do you expect to
observe when you run the following code snippet?

```python
x = 4
y = ', how u doin?'
z = x + y
print(z)
print('Data type of z: ', type(z))
```

> Note: if you do want to explicitly set the data types of certain variables,
> perhaps to ensure that they never change, you can use what are known as **constructor** functions.

### Text in Python

### Numbers in Python

Numbers can be represented in Python either as an ```int```,  ```float``` or  ```complex```.
Further, several operations can be performed on them as shown in the table below.

and the operations that can be performed on them,

### Python sequences

There are two basic sequence types: lists and tuples. A Python list is used to store multiple items in a single variable. A tuple is similar to a python list, but a key difference is that a list can be modified once created, but a tuple can't. In Pythonic terms, a list is mutable, whereas a tuple is inmutable.

There are also slight differences in how they are declared and assigned.

```python
cities_list = ["Breda", "Tilburg", "Amsterdam", "Rotterdam", "Groningen"]
print(cities_list)
```

```python
cities_tuple = ("Breda", "Tilburg", "Amsterdam", "Rotterdam", "Groningen")
print(cities_tuple)
```

Please create your own lists and observe what happends when you apply the following list and tuple operations on your lists.

> Remember that Python is dynamically typed.

One of the coolest features about Python and it's lists are list comprehensions! In general there is a very common for loop structure that looks like this:

```python
new_list = []
for x in y:
    new_element = transform(x)
    new_list.append(new_element)
```

List comprehension rearranges the for loop (minus the append) in a single line that makes your code more readable and "pythonic".

```python
new_list = [transform(x) for x in y]
```

Please watch the following video to understand list comprehensions.

### Python Dictionaries

A Python dictionary is a data type which is a collection of variables.
A simple example of a dictionary data type is your phone contacts. It contains a
a key which is your contacts' name, and values such as surname, phone number, address, birthday etc.
Dictionaries in Python are also represented using ```key:value``` pairs.

A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}.
Placing a comma-separated list of ```key:value``` pairs within the braces adds initial
```key:value``` pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written
on output.

For example, one can represent a contact list in Python using the following syntax.

```python
my_contacts = {"Jan": {"name": "Jan Peters Jones", "address": "2 Breda", "phone": "0678456732"},
               "Marcella": {"name": "Marcella Huizinga", "address": "31 Groningen", "phone": "08 957834321"}
              }
```

To retrieve the details for ```Jan```, we run the following code

```python
print(my_contacts['Jan'])
```

If we further only want to retrieve Jan's phone number, then we can further run

```python
print(my_contacts['Jan']['phone'])
```
