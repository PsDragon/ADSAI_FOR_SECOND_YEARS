# 3. Data Lab 1: Python Foundation exercises

If you had succesfully completed the workshop assignments yesterday, you should
now have:

- [ ] Your Python IDE set-up
- [ ] Familiarity with Python syntax
- [ ] A basic understanding of variable assignment, conditionals, loops and functions
     in Python.

In today's data lab, you will merge these concepts and solve the following use-cases using
Python.

> Please note that these assignments are auto-graded and will count towards your final grade in python.
> To submit your final code for grading, please go to your Github Repositories and open ```Python for Data Analysis/Week1/DataLab1.py```

## 1. Hello World!

- [ ] Write a Python function which returns the string ```HelloWorld```.

## 2. a, b, or c?

- [ ] Write a Python function which:
  - [ ]  accepts a given number as a function parameter.
  - [ ]  checks if the given number is even or odd.
  - [ ]  prints "even" if the number is even.
  - [ ]  prints "odd" if the number is odd.
  - [ ]  has a default value of 7 if no number if supplied.

## 3. Am I old enough?

- [ ] Write a Python function which can classify an age as either "adult" or "child":
  - [ ]  ages greater than and equal to 18 are classified as adult.
  - [ ]  ages less than 18 are classified as child.

> There's a bug in this program. Bonus points if you can find it.

## 4. RVIM Vaccine Registration

The following table indicates the vaccination schedule for people who
are not in medically at-risk or high-risk groups, who live at home and can
access the vaccination location on their own, and who do not work in healthcare

**Using Jupyter notebooks, write a Python function which prints out the location for a user supplied year of birth.**

 Assume that Year of Birth will be provided in the exact format as in the table.

 > hint: use the string equals to (==) operator.

**Write a Python function which implements the logic presented in the flowchart.**

> Hint: Use your powers of abstraction to translate the information into simple Yes/no
questions and try to design a simpler flowchart/algorithm.
