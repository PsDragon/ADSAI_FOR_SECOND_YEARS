# Python: Coding standards and reproducible data science

In today's self study day, you will familiarise yourself with two concepts related to programming, but not writing code yourself! The first concept is related to good coding practices, and the second ensures that the program you write can be easily executed by others.

## Today's learning objectives

- [ ] Explore PEP 8 - Python's in-house coding standard.
- [ ] Understand why reproducible data science matters and investigate methods to ensure reproduciblity.

## Coding Standards: PEP 8 Python Style guide

The Python Enhancement Proposal 8 or PEP 8 (pep like pep guardiola) is a styling guide for Python code. Following a style guide such as the PEP 8 improves the readability and overall understanding of Python code. However, like any style guide, PEP 8 is not always applicable in every circumstance. The key is the use the style guide consistently when you can (and that comes with more coding experience). Please watch this video which walks you through some of the key features of PEP8.

## Reproducible data science
A key feature of a reproducible piece of code is that any person, at any given day, in any given computing machine should be able to run your analysis and arrive at the same conclusions as you have. In practice, this is easier said than done. When you share a script, you can’t necessarily guarantee that the person receiving the script has all the same environmental components that you do – the same version of Python and the same version of libraries you use. This can result in the outcomes of your documented and scripted process turning out differently on a different machine.

## Testing and Debugging

Testing is one of the most critical components of writing good code. Testing code thoroughly and frequently is vital to ensure reliable, reproducible research.It is very, very easy to make mistakes when coding. A single misplaced character can cause a program’s output to be entirely wrong.  Everyone makes mistakes, and in data science, the results can be catastrophic. Careers can be damaged/ended, vast sums of money can be wasted, and valuable time may be lost to exploring incorrect avenues. This is why tests are vital. Please watch the following video to understand why data scientists need to learn how to test their code.
