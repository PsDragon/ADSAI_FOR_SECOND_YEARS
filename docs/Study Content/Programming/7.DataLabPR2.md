# 3. Data Lab 2: Python data structures exercises

If you had succesfully completed the workshops this week, you should
now have:

- [x] Your Python IDE set-up (Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks)
- [x] Familiarity with Python syntax
- [x] A basic understanding of variable assignment, conditionals, loops and functions
     in Python.
- [x] Familiarity with Python data types and data structures
- [x] Familiarity with Python ```pandas```
- [x] Familiarity with Python ```unittests```

In today's data lab, you will merge these concepts and solve the following use-cases using
Python.

## 1. RVIM Vaccine Registration

The following table indicates the vaccination schedule for people who
are not in medically at-risk or high-risk groups, who live at home and can
access the vaccination location on their own, and who do not work in healthcare

Year of Birth  |  Vaccine registration  |  Vaccine  | Location
-------------- |  ------------------------- | ----------| -------
1931 or earlier|	From 25 January 2021	    |BioNTech   |	Groningen
1932 - 1936	   |  From 29 January 2021	    |Pfizer     | Arnhem
1937 - 1941    |	From 5 February 2021	    |Pfizer 	  | Breda
1942 - 1946	   |  From 6 March 2021	        |Moderna	  | Harlingen
1947 - 1951	   |  From 6 April 2021	        |Moderna	  | Edam
1952 - 1955	   |  From 15 April 2021	      |AstraZeneca|	Amsterdam
1956 - 1957	   |  From 15 February 2021	    |AstraZeneca| Sittard
1958 - 1960    |  From 15 April 2021	      |Moderna    |	Rotterdam
1961 - 1971	   |  From 27 April 2021	      |Janssen    |	Groningen
1972 - 1981	   |  From early June 2021	    |Janssen    |	Arnhem
1982 - 1991	   |  From mid-June 2021	      |Moderna    | Breda
1992 or later  |  From mid-June 2021	      |BioNTech   |	Maastricht

**Write a Python function which prints out the location for a user supplied year of birth. Use a Pandas dataframe to store
and retrieve data. Last, write a unit test to ensure that your code is working reliably.**

## 2. Titanic data investigation using Pandas.

In this exercise, you will use Python ```pandas``` to investigate the Titanic
dataset. 

> Note: Use https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data to download and explore the dataset. <br>
> Only download train.csv

After you have download the file, please upload it to your Github Repository ensuring the data is in the same location as the DataLab2.py script. <br>
Use the following python command to read the data.

```python
import pandas as pd

titanic_df = pd.read_csv('/train.csv')
```

Please write Python functions to answer the following questions:

1. How many woman were on the ship?
2. What was the average age of all passengers on the ship?<br>

<mark>[ Optional ]</mark> <br>
3. Group the data into age groups (young, adult, old) and find which age group
had the highest number of passengers?
  - ages greater than and equal to 18 but lesser than 60 are classified as adult.
  - ages less than 18 are classified as young.
  - ages greater than 60 are classified as old.

## 3. Unit Testing

In this exercise, you will create a dummy dataset and design unit tests to ensure that the logic applied in the previous exercise is reliable and correct.

1. Create a pandas dataframe named "Titanic_dummy" with 10 rows and two columns Sex and Age (ensure that the column names are the same as in the Titanic Dataset).
2. Populate the dataframe with values of your choosing.
3. Design unit tests to check if the function you created in the previous exercise to count the number of woman in the dataset returns the correct values, when you pass in the dummy dataset.

We will cover ```Pandas``` in more detail in week3 and encounter this famous dataset again!

# Bonus exercices

If you are done with the previous exercices, please attempt the following two assignments and upload your code to Github.


## 4. Pythoshop:

- [ ] Create a numpy array **heart** with the following values as shown below:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

heart_img = np.array([[255,0,0,255,0,0,255],
              [0,255/2,255/2,0,255/2,255/2,0],
          [0,255/2,255/2,255/2,255/2,255/2,0],
          [0,255/2,255/2,255/2,255/2,255/2,0],
              [255,0,255/2,255/2,255/2,0,255],
                  [255,255,0,255/2,0,255,255],
                  [255,255,255,0,255,255,255]])
```

- [ ] visualize the array using the helper function

```python
def show_image(image, img_title):
  plt.imshow(image, cmap="gray")
  plt.title(img_title)
  plt.show()
```

> Can you figure out how the NumPy array heart_img creates that image you see? Take some time to think.

- [ ] subtract 255 from each value and observe what happens to the image when
you plot it
- [ ] save the modified array as a new numpy array **broken_heart**
- [ ] display the modified array along with the original array.

## 5. Pixel art & NFTs!

Create your own 10X10 greyscale pixel art using numpy arrays. For an additional
challenged, try to create an animation.

> An animation (gif) is just a sequence of image frames moving in rapid succesion.

> If you are now curious as to how a computer represents colour images, please watch the following video
