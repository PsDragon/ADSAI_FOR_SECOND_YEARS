# Getting Started with Python NumPy

```Numpy``` is a Python library for numerical computing. In addition to ```pandas```, it is one of the key pieces in the Python data science toolkit! NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays and matrices. Since data science often involves performing operations on arrays and matrices*, NumPy is an integral component in a large majority of data science projects in Python.

## Today's learning objectives
- [ ] Understand how to learn and use NumPy.
- [ ] Understand the dimensions of a NumPy array.
- [ ] Perform basic operations using NumPy.

Please watch the following video to learn more about ```Numpy``` and understand how it is related to ```pandas```.

## NumPy arrays

An array is a data structure that defines the NumPy library[1]. Similar to a list, a NumPy array contains variables that can be indexed in various ways. However, unlike a list, the elements are all of the same type, referred to as the array dtype. To create a NumPy array, we first create a list (using ```[]```) and then convert the list into a NumPy array as shown below.

```python
import numpy as np

#initialize a numpy array
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
```

Similar to Python lists, we can access elements of a NumPy array using indexes.
To print the first element of ```a```, we use the following array indexing which will return 1.

```python
import numpy as np

#initialize a numpy array
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
print(a[0])
```

To initialize a matrix (or a multidimensional ndarray), we can use nested lists (using ```[[..],[..]]```).


```python
import numpy as np

#initialize a multidimensional numpy array
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]])
print(a.shape)
```
