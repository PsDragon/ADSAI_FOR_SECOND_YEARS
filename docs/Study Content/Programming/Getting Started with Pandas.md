# Pandas

```pandas``` is a Python package providing data frames - fast, flexible, and expressive data structure designed to make working with tabular data both easy and intuitive. It is one of the key pieces in the Python data science toolkit!

pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data [1]:

1. Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet
2. Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.
3. Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels
4. Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure

Please watch the following video to learn more about ```pandas```.

## Installing Pandas

The simplest way to install not only pandas, but Python and the most popular packages that make up the SciPy stack is with Anaconda, which you have already installed.

## Dataframes

A pandas dataframe is a data structure that can be best understood as a list of lists.
A data frame is a matrix of data, containing rows and columns.
