# Python: Coding standards and Reproducible research

In today's self study day, you will familiarise yourself with two concepts related to programming, but not writing code yourself! The first concept is related to good coding practices, and the second ensures that the program you write can be easily executed by others.

## PEP 8 Python Style guide

The Python Enhancement Proposal 8 or PEP 8 is a styling guide for Python code. Following a style guide such as the PEP 8 improves the readability and overall understanding of Python code. However, like any style guide, PEP 8 is not always applicable in every circumstance. The key is the use the style guide consistently when you can. I highly recommend reading the style guide in full (see [here](https://pep8.org/)) and try to apply it your creative brief.
