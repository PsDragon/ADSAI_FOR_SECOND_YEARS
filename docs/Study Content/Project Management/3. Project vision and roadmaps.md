# Project vision and roadmaps

A project without a vision - and a roadmap - to achieve that vision, is
doomed to fail!

The project vision is the map that will guide you and your team to your destination.
The product owner establishes this before any work begins.
The vision tells you, your team, everyone really, where you're going and what
valuable product or enhancement you'll deliver at the end to the client.

The roadmap decomposes the project vision into small functional features or slices
of work that help us achieve the vision.
