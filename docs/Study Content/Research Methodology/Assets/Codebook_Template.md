###Notes on the original (raw) data 
Some additional notes (if avaialble, otherwise you can leave this section out). E.g. how are the images to be stored? How is text data stored?

##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
Description on how to create the tidy data file (1. download the data, ...)/

###Cleaning of the data
Short, high-level description of what the cleaning script does. [link to the readme document that describes the code in greater detail]()


## Variables/Data Organisation
##Description of the variables/images/text/data in the dataset. General description of the dataset file such as:
 - Summary of the data
 - Dimensions of the dataset
 - Variables present in the dataset where relevant
 - Labels/Channels/Features/Masks/Boxes/Vectors/Segmentations/Relationships/Classes (type of) present in the dataset where relevant
 - File type(s)
 - File location(s)
 - Other relevant info?

### Variable/Data Array 1 (<-- Name the variable here, repeat this section for all variables in the dataset)
Short description in bullet points of what the variable/data array describes such as:
 - Name of the variable/data array.
 - What the variable represents.
 - How the variable was measured (e.g. nominal, ordinal, scale).
 - Class of the variable  (i.e. numeric, string)
 - Unique values/levels/dimensions of the variable (how many characters wide it is; how many decimal places it has, height-width-format of the image, tile dimensions/coordinates/indices etc.).
 - Unit of measurement (e.g. nominal, ordinal, scale, if no unit of measurement then list this as well).
 - For categorical variables: If coded numerically, the numeric codes and what they represent.
 - In case names follow some schema, describe how entries were constructed (for example gyroscope sensory John has 3 levels of descriptors in a Cartesian coordiante systems: X-Y-Z. Describe these 3 levels).
