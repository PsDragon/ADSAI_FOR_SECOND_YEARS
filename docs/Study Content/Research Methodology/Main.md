# 1. Research Methodology: A Primer
To gain a new understanding for a given business or academic problem an analytics translator will use quantitative and qualitative research methods of various kinds to attempt to create some new understanding which contributes to a solution. These research methods consist of a study design and data management method to systematically gain new understanding in an efficient, valid, ethicial and safe manner. 

## What are we going to do?
For our research problem we’re going to collect and utilize both qualitative and quantitative data by hosting interviews and collecting questionnaire responses.

## How are we going to do it?
By designing a study which includes an experiment. 
**Study Design** is all about collecting and analysing data in an efficient, valid and ethical way. To start designing a study systematically we first need to form research questions based on our research problem, from the research questions we can then from hypotheses. To answer our hypotheses we then need to create a hypothesis-drive research tool; a questionnaire and interview, for which we come up with a data analysis approach. Once we’ve done that we finish our design for the whole data handling cycle by creating a plan to set up our study, collect the data and evaluate the quality of the data. 

Because our study involves humans, we also need to consider the ethical aspects of our study which means:

Data Management:
In order to design and implement research studies which include active data collection for hypothesis testing and problem solving we need to develop and implement a Data Management Plan (DMP). Developing a DMP means considering all potential risks and uses of the data and design rules ad procedures to accommodate those risks and uses. Implementing means actually managing the data within the organisation, and storing and handling it safely according to the DMP you have set out.

Realizing the data project [professional ILO]:
Following your research methodology doesn’t just mean writing and executing a study design and data management plan! It also means managing the project and team in order to realize the project goals; in order words managing the human and organisational aspect of the project!
