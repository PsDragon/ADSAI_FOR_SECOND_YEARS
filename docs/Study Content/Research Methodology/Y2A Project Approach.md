# 1. Y1A Project Approach
To gain a new understanding for a given business or academic problem an **analytics translator** will use quantitative and qualitative research methods of various kinds to attempt to create some new understanding which contributes to a solution. These research methods consist of a study design and data management method to systematically gain new understanding in an efficient, valid, ethicial and safe manner. 

## What are we going to do?
For our research problem we’re going to collect and utilize both qualitative and quantitative data by hosting interviews and collecting questionnaire responses. 

## How are we going to do it?
By designing a study which includes an experiment. 
**Study Design** is all about collecting and analysing data in an efficient, valid and ethical way. To start systematically designing a study, we first need to form research questions based on our research problem, and from these research questions we can from hypotheses. To answer our hypotheses we then need to create a hypothesis-driven research tool; a questionnaire and interview in this case, for which we come up with a data analysis approach. Once we’ve done that, we will finish our design for the whole data handling cycle by creating a plan to set up our study, collect and manage the data and evaluate the quality of the data. 

The mandatory knowledge modules are:

- [ ] [Research Methods:](https://www.coursera.org/learn/research-methods){:target="_blank"} <br> Complete the first 3 week modules and take a screenshot of each completed quiz; your score does not count towards your final grade, and attach it to your learning log. Do the week 4 module on Thursday the 15th of September, reflect on your research design in your learning log in a separate slide and iterate on it accordingly.
- [ ] [Qualitative Methods:](https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantitative-methods){:target="_blank"} Complete the first 6 week modules and take a screenshot of each completed quiz; your score does not count towards your final grade, and attach it to your learning log. 
- [ ] Qualitative Methods: Covered by a Guest Lecture by Shima Rezaeirashnoo on Monday Week 2 from 10:00 - 12:00 and workshops on both datalab days in week 2.

A proposed [day-by-day timeline can be found here](https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/ADS-AI/blob/a9ba05679849e27a208eae8579058b8b42fc8f79/docs/Study%20Content/Research%20Methodology/Y2blockA_PlanningProposal.xlsx) if you find that helpful.

Because our study involves humans, we also need to consider the ethical aspects of our study which means:

Data Management:
In order to design and implement research studies which include active data collection for hypothesis testing and problem solving we need to develop and implement a Data Management Plan (DMP). Developing a DMP means considering all potential risks and uses of the data and design rules ad procedures to accommodate those risks and uses. Implementing means actually managing the data within the organisation, and storing and handling it safely according to the DMP you have set out. An organisation conducting research like Breda University of Applied Sciences usually has a dedicated plan to deal with Research Data because this is effective and ethical; furthermore it is legally mandated by the European Union so it's an actual legal requirement. Create a Data Management Plan using the [Research Data Management Guide](https://edubuas.sharepoint.com/sites/researchdevelopment/SitePages/Datamanagement.aspx) of Breda University of Applied Sciences. 

Realizing the data project [@Nitin professional ILO? It's not in the assessment rubric; should we put it in or shall I delete this whole section? I think it would be more ecological valid if they actually have a project management component as ILO right?]:
Following your research methodology doesn’t just mean writing and executing a study design and data management plan! It also means managing the project and team in order to realize the project goals; in order words managing the human and organisational aspect of the project!
