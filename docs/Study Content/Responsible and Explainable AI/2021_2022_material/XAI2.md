# DataLab 1: XAI

In today's DataLab, we will learn how to apply the methods we were introduced to in yesterdays workshop; and further, investigate the applicability of these methods to the creative brief.

## Learning Objectives:

- [ ] Understand how to interepret PDPs
- [ ] Apply LIME to the (f)mnist dataset for explaining image classification
- [ ] Investigate the applicability of these methods to the creative brief.

## Preparation
- [ ] Written assignment on XAI.

- [ ] Apply PDPs to your model and explain it's findings. Please open the ```XAI_DataLab1_PDP``` notebook you can find in your Github Repositories in Google Colab and follow the instructions provided in the Notebook.


## Day outline

### Partial Dependence Plots [1 hour]
- [ ] Ensure you know how to estimate, plot and interpret  partial dependence plots.

### LIME [3 hours]
- [ ] Please open the ```XAI_DataLab1_LIME``` notebook you can find [here](https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/Programming-Sandbox/blob/main/XAI/XAI_DataLab1_LIME.ipynb) and follow the instructions provided in the Notebook.

### Deep Learning Creative Brief [3 hours]
- [ ] Please use this session to post open questions about the creative brief.
