## 3) Workshop: The Difference Between Equality and Equity:

Now, we're introduced to the terms 'fairness' and 'bias' it's time to ground down these fundamentals. In the workshop, you will learn about how two principles, equality and equity, can help to achieve fairness.

> Though often used interchangeably, equality and equity are quite different. If fairness is the goal, equality and equity are two processes through which we can achieve it. Equality simply means everyone is treated the same exact way, regardless of need or any other individual difference. Equity, on the other hand, means everyone is provided with what they need to succeed. In an equality model, a coach gives all of his players the exact same shoes. In an equity model, the coach gives all of his players shoes that are their size.
