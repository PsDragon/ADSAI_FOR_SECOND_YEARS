# Fairness & Bias: Definitions

<img src="./images/fairness.jpg" alt="Fairness" width="600">

<br> This week you will be introduced to the subfield of Responsible AI, which has the objective to ensure AI is safe, trustworthy, and unbiased.

Today, you will be introduced to the concepts of 'fairness' and 'bias'. How are they defined? Are there different types of 'fairness' and/or 'bias' Lastly, you will be made familiar with two principles that can be applied to achieve fairness; equality and equity.

## 1) Learning Objectives:

1. Define the terms 'individual fairness', 'group fairness', 'bias', 'equity', and 'equality'.
2. Describe the three types of bias, and connect them to the CRISP-DM cycle phases by providing concrete examples.
3. Explain the difference between the terms 'equity' and 'equality'.

## 2) Introduction:

Artificial Intelligence, often in the form of machine learning, underpins decisions that profoundly affect our society. For example, it may decide if you get car insurance or if you are eligible for parole.

Machine learning makes use of data by learning through the generalization of examples, defining that apply for past cases, but also predicting future unseen cases (See Figure 1).

ML can be very useful to make data-driven decisions, uncovering relevant factors that humans might overlook. However, it does not ensure fair decisions. For example:

> Bias often appears in AI systems through factors like race or gender that arenâ€™t directly inputted into the system, but still have a strong influence on their decisions. Discrimination can happen when one of these attributes is strongly correlated with information that is directly used by the system. For example, suppose a system that makes decisions about credit uses zip code as a factor to make its decisions. The direct information about race is not given to the system, but zip code is strongly correlated with race since many neighborhoods are still segregated. By using zip code, the system would be indirectly making decisions based on race. In this case, zip code is a proxy for race ([Source](https://engineering.cmu.edu/news-events/news/2018/12/11-datta-proxies.html)).

Before we can start with our quest to make AI more 'fair'. We need to define the concept a bit further:

__2a__ Watch the video Why monkeys (and humans) are wired for fairness by Sarah Brosnan.

*Video 1. Why monkeys (and humans) are wired for fairness.*

__2b__ Explain how the terms 'fairness' and 'cooperation' relate to each other by giving a real-life example. Write your answer down.

__2c__ Read the comic book Fairness & Friends by Khan et., al., which you can find, [here]( https://dataresponsibly.github.io/comics/vol2/fairness_en.pdf).

__2d__ List, and describe the three types of bias presented in the comic book.

*Figure 2. CRISP-DM cycle.*

__2e__ Give an example for each type of bias presented in the comic book, and connect it to one of the CRISP-DM phases. Write your answer down, and limit your word count to a maximum of 150 words.

## 3) Workshop: The Difference Between Equality and Equity:

Now, we are introduced to the terms 'fairness' and 'bias', it is time to deepen our knowledge. In the workshop, you will learn about how two principles, equality and equity, can help to achieve fairness:

> Though often used interchangeably, equality and equity are quite different. If fairness is the goal, equality and equity are two processes through which we can achieve it. Equality simply means everyone is treated the same exact way, regardless of need or any other individual difference. Equity, on the other hand, means everyone is provided with what they need to succeed. In an equality model, a coach gives all of his players the exact same shoes. In an equity model, the coach gives all of his players shoes that are their size ([Source](https://risetowin.org/what-we-do/educate/resource-module/equality-vs-equity/index.html)).

### 3.1 Individual exercises

__3.1a__ Read the Post-Its in Figure 3.

<img src="./images/connecting_post_its.png" alt="Books banner" width="600"/>

*Figure 3. Post-Its on a bulletin board.*

__3.1a__ Fill the gaps in the 'text' Post-Its by connecting it to the correct 'concept' Post-It. Write your answer down.

__3.1b__ Provide answers to the following answers. Provide clear, and concise answers.  

<img src="./images/equityvsequality.jpg" alt="Books banner" width="450"/>

*Figure 4. Equality vs equity.*

1. Looking at the images in Figure 4, why does the difference between equity and equality matter?
2. How does the baseball game metaphor relate to the guiding quote about shoes?
3. What are some other real-world examples of equity and equality?
3. How are equality and equity related to fairness? In school, sports, society, etc.?
4. Are there other ways to achieve fairness besides equity and equality? (For example, the removal of the wooden fence eliminates the structural barrier to access.)

### 3.2 Group exercises

__3.2a__ Team up with at least one fellow student, and discuss your answers to the individual exercises. Write down the name(s) of your teammate(s), and the differences/commonalities in your provided answers.

## 4) Additional material (optional):

This part of the independent study material is optional. You are not required to complete the following questions. However, they will help you to deepen your understanding of the concepts presented in the independent study material.

### 4.1 Justice as fairness by John Rawls

Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is a trustworthy online source that provides extensive information on philosophy, and related fields. You can access their entry on the philosopher John Rawls, [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/).

In addition, The School of Life, also has provides high quality videos on various philosophical topics. See YouTube video on Rawl's political theory:
