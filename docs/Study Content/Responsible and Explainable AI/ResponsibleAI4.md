__2b__ Visit Google's Know Your Data webpage, which you can find [here](https://knowyourdata.withgoogle.com/).

__2c__  Visit IBM's AI Fairness 360 Toolkit, which you can find [here](https://aif360.mybluemix.net/).

__2d__ Create an table where you compare the three fairness enhancing tools. Include relevant topics such as supported data types, UX design, accessibility, documentation (e.g. tutorials) etc.

## 2) Workshop: Applied responsible AI

Now, we are introduced to the tools, it is time to explore them a bit further. In today's workshop, you will learn to apply the fairness enhancing techniques to a dataset.

### 2.1 Exploration:

__2.1a__ Find at least one dataset online. Not sure where to start? Visit [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/):

>Inside Kaggle youâ€™ll find all the code & data you need to do your data science work. Use over 50,000 public datasets and 400,000 public notebooks to conquer any analysis in no time.

__2.1b__ Use the fairness enhancing tools on your dataset(s). Upload a Jupyter notebook with the results of you analyses to GitHub.

## 3) Additional material (optional):

This part of the independent study material is optional. You are not required to complete the following questions. However, they will help you to deepen your understanding of the concepts presented in the independent study material.

### 3.1 CodeAcademy: Exploratory Data Analysis in Python

If you need a bit more practice with performing EDAs, see the learning path [Exploratory Data Analysis in Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/eda-exploratory-data-analysis-python)  on CodeAcademy.
