# __Responsible & Explainable AI__

## __Assignment__

For this part of the Project Brief, you are going to identify, and describe the limitations of an AI algorithm in terms of fairness, transparency, and interpretability, and subsequently apply methods that address these limitations.

__Deliverable(s):__

- A Jupyter/Colaboratory Notebook that contains relevant code and explanations.

The Jupyter/Colaboratory notebook is to be uploaded to GitHub no later than 5pm on last DataLab day. Confer with a lecturer beforehand if you are handing in something other than a Jupyter/Colaboratory Notebook.
