# DataLab: XAI using Keras

In today's DataLab, you are expected to apply one explainable AI technique,
namely feature/pixel attribution to your creative brief. In particular, you
are expected to use the ```tf-keras-vis``` python library to generate
explanations for your image classification creative brief.

## Learning Objectives:

- Import Python packages/libraries.
- Load your image dataset.
- Apply appropriate processing techniques to the dataset.
- Select appropriate image classification model to fit on the dataset.
- Apply atleast two feature/pixel attribution algorithms to the model.
- Evaluate the performance of the AI algorithm in terms of it's explanatory power.

## Questions or issues?
If you have any questions or issues regarding the course material, please first ask your peers or ask us in the Q&A in Datalab!
