# Feature Attribution in Computer Vision
Feature attribution methods help us understand how a particular neural network architecture makes it's prediction. The most common (and simple) feature attribution method is called a saliency map — a simple heatmap that highlights pixels of the input image that most likely caused the output. In today's workshop, we learn more about such maps and the different methods that can be used to obtain them.

## Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand how to compute Vanilla Gradients
- [ ] Understand how to compute Grad-CAMs.
- [ ] Understand how to compute SmoothGrad.
- [ ] Learn how to use ```tf-keras-vis``` to obtain saliency maps.

### Saliency maps using vanilla gradients

### Saliency maps using Grad-CAMs

### Saliency maps using SmoothGrad

## Saliency Maps in Practice (```tf-keras-vis```)
