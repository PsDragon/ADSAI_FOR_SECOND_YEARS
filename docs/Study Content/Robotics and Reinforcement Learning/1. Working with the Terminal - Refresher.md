## Useful Commands

### List Directory Entries
To list the files and folders that are present in the current directory use the following command:

    dir

########IMAGE WHEN DIR IS RUN

### Change Directory
The _cd_ command can be used to change the current directory by typing _cd_ followed by the desired directory or folder you want to change to:

    cd folder_name

########IMAGE WHEN MOVING TO A NEW FOLDER

If you follow up the _cd_ command with 2 fullstops you can move up (back) one directory:

    cd ..

You can also navigate to a directory that is not within your current directory using its full path:

    cd full_path/my_folder

########IMAGE WHEN MOVING TO A FOLDER USING FULL PATH
    
### Create/Remove Folder/Directory

    mkdir folder_name
    rmdir folder_name
    rmdir /s folder_name 

### Create/Remove File

    type nul > filename.txt
    del filename
    del /f filename
    copy con testfile.txt
    echo enter your text here > filename.txt

## Running Programs

### Programs on path: 
If programs are on the path then you can simply type the name of the program into the terminal and the press enter to run the program.

Try run the following commands:


    code

    calc

    calc.exe

The path is an environment variable that specifies where the OS should look for programs to run when a command is executed.

### Programs not on path:

If a program is not on the path then the OS will not recognise the name of the program as a valid command.
By default the current working directory is added to the path of the current terminal session. The names of prgrams that are in the current directory will be recognised as commands.

First navigate to folder where the exe file is located. Then run the command.

- Example of running python if not on path by navigating to folder here

Or run the command including the full path.

## Python in the Terminal
### Check Python Version
    python --version
### Running Python Scripts
    python MyScript.py

     - Make a gif for hello world as EG

### Installing Python Packages - PIP

    pip install package_name
    pip install package_name == version

Installing Python packages directly using _pip_ is not advised. It is preferred to use virtual environments with a environment manager like Anaconda. Once the virtual environment is active you can install using _pip_ or the managers native package installer (_conda_ in the case of Anaconda)
