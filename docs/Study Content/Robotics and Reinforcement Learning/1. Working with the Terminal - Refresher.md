## Launching a Windows Terminal
Windows has 2 built in terminal options:
- Powershell
- Command Prompt

To launch either of these just press the Windows key and type the program name into the search bar, then click on the program to launch.

## Useful Commands
Here some useful commands that are commonly used are listed aand explained. The commannds below are all for windows terminals but most of them will work in Linux terminals as well.

### List Directory Entries
To list the files and folders that are present in the current directory use the following command:

    dir

I have created a folder on my desktop called _TestFolder_ and populated it with a few files. When the dir command is run, a list of the files and folders in the current directory (in this case _TestFolder_ on the Desktop)

<div style="text-align: center"> 
<img src="Images/dir.png" height="280" />
</div>

### Change Directory
The _cd_ command can be used to change the current directory by typing _cd_ followed by the desired directory or folder you want to change to. The directory needs to be contained in the current directory. To move from the Desktop (current directory) to _TestFolder_ the following command would be used: 

    cd TestFolder

<div style="text-align: center"> 
<img src="Images/cd.png" height="160" />
</div>

If you follow up the _cd_ command with 2 fullstops you can move up (back) one directory:

    cd .. 

<div style="text-align: center"> 
<img src="Images/cd...png" height="160" />
</div> 

You can also navigate to a directory that is not within your current directory using its full path. To navigate from the current folder to a folder called _Python Scripts_ in Documents the following command would be used:

    cd C:\Users\aswegen.d\Documents\Python Scripts

<div style="text-align: center"> 
<img src="Images/cdpath.png" height="160" />
</div> 

The full path starts with the drive that the folder is located on followed by the list of each folder that needs to be navigated through to get to the desired directory separated by forward slashes - /
    
### Create/Remove Folder/Directory

    mkdir folder_name
    rmdir folder_name
    rmdir /s folder_name 

### Create/Remove File

    type nul > filename.txt
    del filename
    del /f filename
    copy con testfile.txt
    echo enter your text here > filename.txt

## Running Programs
To run a program you simply need to type its name into the command prompt, however with a program name will be recognised depends if it is on the system path or not.

### Programs on path: 
If programs are on the path then you can simply type the name of the program into the terminal and the press enter to run the program.

Try run the following commands:


    code

    calc

    calc.exe

The path is an environment variable that specifies where the OS should look for programs to run when a command is executed.

### Programs not on path:

If a program is not on the path then the OS will not recognise the name of the program as a valid command.
By default the current working directory is added to the path of the current terminal session. The names of prgrams that are in the current directory will be recognised as commands.

First navigate to folder where the exe file is located. Then run the command.

- Example of running python if not on path by navigating to folder here

Or run the command including the full path.

## Python in the Terminal
### Check Python Version

    python --version
### Running Python Scripts
    python MyScript.py

     - Make a gif for hello world as EG

### Installing Python Packages - PIP

    pip install package_name
    pip install package_name == version

Installing Python packages directly using _pip_ is not advised. It is preferred to use virtual environments with a environment manager like Anaconda. Once the virtual environment is active you can install using _pip_ or the managers native package installer (_conda_ in the case of Anaconda)

## Test Your Skills <img src="Images/challenge.png" height="40" />

Do the following all using the terminal:
- Create a folder on the Desktop called: _I can use the terminal!_
- Create these files in the folder:
>> - A Microsoft Word document 
>> - A text file called _click me!.txt_
>> - A csv file
>> - A Python file called _HelloWorld.py_
>>>> - The python file should contain the following line of code:
    
>>>>>     print("Hello World!")
- Run the python file
