# Gym Environment Wrapper Planning 

In tomorrow's datalab, we will be creating a custom gym environment wrapper for the RoboSuite environment. This will allow us to use the RoboSuite environment with Stable Baselines 3. It will also allow us to define our own actions, observations, and reward function. This will follow on from the Cognition fundamentals work in the first part of the datalab.

- What is the goal of the wrapper? (What is the task you want to train for)
- What are the inputs of the wrapper? (What is the action space)
- What are the outputs of the wrapper? 
    - Observation (What observations are relevant?)
    - Reward (How should the reward be structured?)
    - Done (Under what conditions should the episode terminate?)
