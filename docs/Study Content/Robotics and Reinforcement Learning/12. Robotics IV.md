# Robotics IV: Controller Performance and Tuning

## Controller Performance

In order to evaluate the performance of a controller, we need to define a performance metric. In other words some number that will tell use how well the controller is performing, and how well it is performing compared to other controllers. We generally want our controllers to quickly reach the desired setpoint (with minimal overshoot or oscillation), and then stay there with minimal steady state error. We also want the controller to be robust to disturbances, and to have a low control effort. We will discuss these performance metrics in more detail below.

In comparing different controllers or the same controller with different parameters we need to be careful to compare apples to apples. For this reason several standard input signals are used to evaluate controllers. These input signals are discussed in more detail below. 

### Standard Input Signals

The 3 most common input signals are the step input, the ramp input, and the sinusoidal input. These input signals are shown below. Generally we want to use the standard input signals that most closely match the type signal that would be seen in practice. For example, when controlling the position of the robots griper with the a PID controller we are just changing the setpoints of the controller by a fixed amount each time we want to move the gripper to a new position. This is similar to a step input, so we would predominantly use a step input to evaluate the performance of the controller.

#### Step Input

A step input is a signal that changes from 0 to a constant value at a certain time. The step input is shown below.

#### Ramp Input (Optional)

A ramp input is a signal that changes from 0 to a constant value at a certain time, but the change is linear instead of instantaneous. The ramp input is shown below.

#### Sinusoidal Input (Optional)

A sinusoidal input is a signal that changes according to the sinusoidal function. It is useful in cases where the input signal is periodic. The sinusoidal input is shown below.

#### Other Input Signals (Optional)
There are many other input signals that can be used to evaluate controllers. These include:

- Sawtooth Input
- Square Wave Input
- Random Input
- Chirp Input
- Impulse Input

Remember that the input signal should be chosen to match the type of input signal that would be seen in practice. For our case we only really need to use the step input, but you can use any of the other input signals if you want to. There are other applications that would require the use of other input signals.

### Controller Performance Metrics

#### Time to complete the task 

#### Accuracy in Completing the task

#### Speed of Response

#### Rise Time

#### Settling Time

#### Overshoot

#### Steady State Error

#### Stability

#### Robustness and Disturbance Rejection (Optional)

Robustness is a measure of how well the controller performs when there is a disturbance. A disturbance is a change in the input signal that is not caused by the controller. For example, if we are controlling the position of a robot gripper, and we want to move the gripper to a new position, the input signal is the desired position of the gripper. If the robot is moving and the gripper is not at the desired position, the controller will try to move the gripper to the desired position. If the robot is bumped while the gripper is moving, the gripper will not reach the desired position. This is a disturbance. The controller should be able to handle disturbances, and still reach the desired position.

#### Control Effort (Optional)

Control effort is a measure of how much energy is used in reaching the setpoint. I many applications we want to minimize the control effort, while maintaining the speed of the response and other performance metrics. This can be thought of as a measure of the efficiency of the controller.
