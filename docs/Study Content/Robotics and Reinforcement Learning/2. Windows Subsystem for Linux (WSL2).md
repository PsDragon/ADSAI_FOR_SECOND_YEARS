# Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2): Running Linux on Windows with GPU Acceleration

## What is Linux? <img src="Images/Linux.png" width="50" height="50" />
Linux is an operating system like Windows and Mac OS. The main difference being that it is both free and open source. Linux is distributed under an open source license which means that anyone is able to access the source code of the operating system and make changes and customisations. Linux has a large community that works on maintaining and updating the linux kernel and distributions (distros). Linux is an operating system that is “by the people, for the people”.

### Linux Distros
Linux comes in many different 'flavours' known as distros. Each distribution is a customisation of the base Linux operating system with a slightly different focus, look and feel. There are distros that cater to beginners who prefer a graphical user interface for most tasks as well as experts that are comfortable working a a terminal only. A few commonly used ditsros are listed below:

- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) \

- [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) \

We will be working with Ubuntu, but feel free to give any other distro a try. (They are free after all)

### Why is linux needed for ADS-AI?
The main arguments for using Linux are that its free, stable, and arguably less susceptible to malware. In general Linux has less compatibility with general applications than Windows or MacOS but when it comes to machine learning libraries this is not the case. Many libraries are released for linux first and MacOS and windows either a lot later or never. 

As a result it is often necessary to have access to both Windows and and Linux this can be done in three ways:
1. Dual booting Windows and Linux 

> This involves having Windows installed on one hard drive or hard drive partition and a Linux distro installed on another drive or drive partition. You can the choose which OS to boot into when you turn your computer on.  

2. Using a Virtual Machine (VM) with a Linux distro installed
> Running full virtual machines does come with some system overhead as well as dificulties with GPU passthrough on some virtualisation packages. But it will allow you to have Windows and Linux running at the same time on the same machine.

3. Using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 
> This is the suggested approach, as it allows you to have Linux running within Windows without the overhead and complication of running a ful VM.


## What is WSL2?
WSL allows you to run a Linux environment within Windows. Which allows you to access a Linux command line and run applications and libraries that were built for Linux. You can install any Linux distro and have multiple versions of the same distro for development and testing. WSL2 is the latest impplementation of WSL. WSL2 also allows for the use of GPU acceleration which is particularly useful for machine learning applications.
