# Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2): Running Linux on Windows with GPU Acceleration

## What is Linux?
Linux is an operating system like Windows and Mac OS. The main difference being that it is both free and open source. Linux is distributed under an open source license which means that anyone is able to access the source code of the operating system and make changes and customisations. Linux has a large community that works on maintaining and updating the linux kernel and distributions (distros). Linux is an operating system that is “by the people, for the people”.

### Linux Distros
Linux comes in many different 'flavours' known as distros. Each distribution is a customisation of the base Linux operating system with a slightly different focus, look and feel. There are distros that cater to beginners who prefer a graphical user interface for most tasks as well as experts that are comfortable working a a terminal only. A few commonly used ditsros are listed below:

- Linux Mint
- Ubuntu
- Debian

We will be working with Ubuntu, but feel free to give any other distro a try. (They are free after all) 

### Why is linux needed for ADS-AI?
The main argument for using Linux is that its free, stable, and arguably less susceptible to malware. In general Linux has less compatibility with other applications than Windows or MacOS but when it comes to machine learning libraries this is not the case, many libraries
