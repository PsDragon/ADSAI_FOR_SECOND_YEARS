# Introduction to Robotics
Automation of manual, repetitive, and dangerous tasks is carried out across many industries in order to reduce labour costs, increase efficiency, and improve working conditions. The addition of data driven techniques like computer vision and reinforcement learning allow for more complex tasks to be automated using robots.   

The focus of this knowledge module is on understanding the basic principles of robotics.

After this module, you will be able to:
- [ ] Develop an understanding of what robotics is and its current and future applications.
- [ ] Develop an understanding of the purpose of the different components of robotic systems.
- [ ] Describe the location and pose of objects in a 3D space.

## What is Robotics?
Robotics is the study of robotic systems, including their design, manufacture and control (operation, and use). A few definitions of robots, or robotic systems are presented below:

- Robotic systems are defined as systems that provide intelligent services and information by interacting with their environment, including human beings, via the use of various sensors, actuators and human interfaces. [( Object Management Group, 2005)](https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/robotic-systems/46626#:~:text=1.,Object%20Management%20Group%2C%202005%20)
- Robots are machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics)
- A robot is a machine, especially one programmable by a computer, capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. (Oxford Dictionary)
- A robot is an autonomous machine capable of sensing its environment, carrying out computations to make decisions, and performing actions in the real world. [(IEEE)](https://robots.ieee.org/learn/what-is-a-robot/)

The last definition is very general, but it best captures the broadness of the field. Especially when considering that machines as complex as Boston Dynamics [Atlas](https://www.bostondynamics.com/atlas) and a [Tesla on Autopilot](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot) all the way down to something as seemingly simple as a [Roomba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RvnlDNTo0E) can be considered to be robots. 

We will be focusing on developing control algorithms for robots, but it is important to have an understanding of what they are and what they components they are comprised of in order to develop functional and efficient control systems.
