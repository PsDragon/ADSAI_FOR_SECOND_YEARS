# Introduction to Robotics
Automation of manual, repetitive, and dangerous tasks is carried out across many industries in order to reduce labour costs, increase efficiency, and improve working conditions. The addition of data driven techniques like computer vision and reinforcement learning allow for more complex tasks to be automated using robots.   

The focus of this knowledge module is on understanding the basic principles of robotics.

After this module, you will be able to:
- [ ] Develop an understanding of what robotics is and its current and future applications.
- [ ] Develop an understanding of the purpose of the different components of robotic systems.
- [ ] Describe the location and pose of objects in a 3D space.

## What is Robotics?
Robotics is the study of robotic systems, including their design, manufacture and control (operation, and use). A few definitions of robots, or robotic systems are presented below:

- Robotic systems are defined as systems that provide intelligent services and information by interacting with their environment, including human beings, via the use of various sensors, actuators and human interfaces. [( Object Management Group, 2005)](https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/robotic-systems/46626#:~:text=1.,Object%20Management%20Group%2C%202005%20)
- Robots are machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics)
- A robot is a machine, especially one programmable by a computer, capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. (Oxford Dictionary)
- A robot is an autonomous machine capable of sensing its environment, carrying out computations to make decisions, and performing actions in the real world. [(IEEE)](https://robots.ieee.org/learn/what-is-a-robot/)

The last definition is very general, but it best captures the broadness of the field. Especially when considering that machines as complex as Boston Dynamics [Atlas](https://www.bostondynamics.com/atlas) and a [Tesla on Autopilot](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot) all the way down to something as seemingly simple as a [Roomba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RvnlDNTo0E) can be considered to be robots.

We will be focusing on developing control algorithms for robots, but it is important to have an understanding of what they are and what they components they are comprised of in order to develop functional and efficient control systems.

## Components of a Robotic System

### Environment
The environment is the world in which the robot operates. The robot needs to be able to percieve it's surroundings and interact which objects within the environment in order to carry out tasks. If we consider the example of an autonomous warehouse robot the environment would be the area in which the robot operates (walls, floor, roof) and all objects (shelves, boxes, people). 

### Sensors
Sensors are the means by which a robot perceives it's environment. The complexity and number of sensors is often directly related to the complexity of the required task. In this example the robot may need to know its location within the environment (warehouse), the distance to nearby objects and possibly what these objects are. A GPS could be used to detect the robots location, and a scanning LiDAR could be used to provide the distances to all nearby objects in the desired field of view. In order to determine what the objects a camera could be used in conjuction with a computer vision algorithm for object detection and classification. 

### Actuators and Effectors
Actuators are the means by which a robot interacts with its environment. These are generally mechanical, or electro-mechanical devices which allow the robot or part of the robot to move. In the case of the warehouse robot the actuators would be the motors that spin its wheels (if it has wheels). If the cobot was fitted with a robotic arm to grasp objects that would the arm linkages themselves would be moved by actuators. These would be either electric mototrs or hydrualic cylinders depending on the arm design. The part of the arm that actually grasps objects (the gripper) is known as an effector, as it physically affects the environment.

### Control Hardware and Algorithms
Both Sensors and actuators are required for an autonomous or semi-autonomous robotic system to accomplish a task within the environment, however there is still one piece missing. The robot needs to be able to process the signals coming in from the sensors and then use this information to decide on its next action. That decision then needs to be turned into appropriate signals to move the actuators in a useful manner. This process is handled by the control algorithm which is run on the control hardware. The hardware and algorithms required will also vary in complexity depending on the complexity of the task. (Roomba vs tesla?)
