# Robotics II: Robotic Control

Robotic control is the process of controlling a robot. The control system is the part of a robot that is responsible for the robot's behavior. This includes the physical movement of the robot, as well as the logical decisions that the robot makes. The control algorithm receives sensor data from the robot's sensors, and then uses this data to make decisions about how to move the robot. It is usually a computer program that is loaded onto the robot's microcontroller. The control system is usually written in a high-level programming language, such as C, C++ or python, and then compiled into machine code that can be executed by the microcontroller.

In this module we will learn about different types of robotic control algorithms, and how to implement them in python.

After this module, you will be able to:

- [ ] Understand the basic concepts of robotic control
- [ ] Describe several commonly used traditional control algorithms
- [ ] Understand the basic concepts of PID control
- [ ] Implement a PID controller in python to solve a classic control problem

## 1. Traditional Control Theory

Control theory is a vast field across all types of engineering, and is a very important topic in robotics. In this section we will cover the basics of control theory, and how it applies to robotics. There are many different types of control algorithms, and we will cover some of the most common ones in this module. The overlap between control theory and data science comes from new data driven control algorithms that are being developed and implemented. These algorithms are based on reinforcement learning, and are able to learn how to control a robot from data. We will cover reinforcement learning in the next module. 

The map of control theory (by Brian Douglas) below shows the different types of control algorithms and other areas of interest, and how they relate to each other. The areas that we will be working with in this module are highlighted in red.

The video below is a great introduction to control theory. It gives an overview of all the important topics, and is a great starting point for learning more about the field. However, it is a high level overview and does not go into the details of any specific control algorithm. You do not need to be an expert in control theory to be successful in this block, but it is a good idea to have a basic understanding of the field so that you can properly implement and evaluate data driven control algorithms. Don't worry if you don't understand everything in the video, you will learn more about the important details in this module.

Important takeaways:
- Control theory is the study of how to control a system, and how to make the system do what you want it to do without manual intervention.
- Feedback control measures the output of the system, and uses this information to make adjustments to the system to achieve the desired output.

Our focus will be on the development and implementation of the controller. We will learn how to implement a simple PID controller as a baseline with which to compare a more complex data driven controller using reinforcement learning.

### 1.1. Error Signals and Controllers

The first 3 minutes of this video are a good introduction to the concept of error signals and controllers.

</div>

In control theory, an error signal is a measure of how far a system is from its desired setpoint. It is used by a control algorithm to determine how to adjust the system in order to bring it closer to the setpoint.

For example, consider a temperature control system for a home heating system. The setpoint is the desired temperature that the system is trying to maintain. The error signal is the difference between the current temperature and the setpoint. If the current temperature is lower than the setpoint, the error signal will be positive, indicating that the system needs to be heated. If the current temperature is higher than the setpoint, the error signal will be negative, indicating that the system needs to be cooled.

The control algorithm uses the error signal to determine how to adjust the system in order to bring the current temperature closer to the setpoint. For example, in a bang-bang control system, the control algorithm may simply turn the heating system on or off depending on whether the error signal is positive or negative. In a more advanced control algorithm, such as PID control, the control algorithm may use the error signal to calculate a more fine-grained control signal that can be used to continuously adjust the system in order to bring it closer to the setpoint.

In the case of controlling a robot arm the error signal is the difference between the current position (x,y, and z) of the gripper and the desired position.

The error signal is an important concept in control theory, as it allows a control algorithm to determine how to adjust a system in order to maintain a desired setpoint.

### 1.2. Bang Bang Control

Bang-bang control is a type of control algorithm that switches a system between two different states in order to maintain a desired setpoint. The name "bang-bang" comes from the on-off nature of the control, which can be thought of as "full speed ahead" (bang) or "full stop" (bang).

An example of bang-bang control is the thermostat in a home heating system. The thermostat maintains the desired temperature setpoint by switching the heating system on or off as needed. If the temperature in the house falls below the setpoint, the thermostat will turn on the heating system (bang) to bring the temperature back up. If the temperature in the house rises above the setpoint, the thermostat will turn off the heating system (bang) to prevent the temperature from getting too high.

Bang-bang control is a simple and effective control method, but it can be somewhat crude and can result in oscillations around the setpoint. It can also cause chatter if the error signal changes too quickly which can damage a systems actuators. More advanced control algorithms, such as PID (proportional-integral-derivative) control, can be used to achieve better performance and smoother control.

### 1.3. PID Control

PID control is a common control algorithm used in many engineering and industrial control systems. It stands for Proportional-Integral-Derivative control, and it is a type of feedback control system that uses feedback to adjust the output of a system to match a desired setpoint.

The following video is a good introduction to PID control. It covers the basics of the algorithm, and how it can be used to control a system:

### Here is a text summary to refer to if you prefer to read rather than watch the videos:

A `PID` controller has three main components: the proportional, integral, and derivative terms. These terms work together to calculate the output of the controller, which is then used to adjust the behavior of the system being controlled.

The `proportional` term is the most straightforward. It is simply a multiplication of the error (the difference between the setpoint and the current output) by a constant called the proportional gain. The proportional term causes the output of the controller to change proportionally to the error, so if the error is large, the output will be large, and if the error is small, the output will be small. Proportional control alone is prone to overshoot, oscillation and steady state error, so it is usually combined with the integral and derivative terms.

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

The `derivative` term is the derivative (or gradient) of the error with respect to time, multiplied by a constant called the derivative gain. The derivative term is used to "predict" the future behavior of the error, based on its current rate of change. This can help to reduce the overshoot and oscillation caused by the proportional term. The derivative term is usually used in conjunction with the proportional term. If just proportional and derivative terms are used, the controller is called a PD controller. However, the PD controller is still susceptible to steady state error, so the integral term is usually added to the controller to help reduce this error.

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="Images/pdcontrol.gif" height="300" />
</div>

The `integral` term is the sum of the error over time, multiplied by a constant called the integral gain. The integral term is used to "integrate" the error over time, so if the error is consistently positive or negative, the output of the controller will continue to increase or decrease, respectively, until the error is eliminated. The integral part of the controller can be susceptible to windup, which is when the output of the actuator becomes saturated and the integral term continues to increase or decrease. This can be addressed by using an anti-windup techniques like clamping or reset windup. Combining the proportional and integral terms is called PI control, however it is still prone to overshoot and oscillation, so it is usually combined with the derivative term.

The gif below shows a steady state error due to damage to the steering of the car after running over some rubble. The integral term is able to reduce the steady state error.

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="Images/pidcontrol.gif" height="300" />
</div>

To combine the effects of the proportional, integral, and derivative terms, they are added together to form the output of the controller. The output of the controller is then used to adjust the behavior of the system being controlled.

Here is an example of how a PID controller might be used to control the temperature of a heating system:

```python	
# define the setpoint (the target temperature)
setpoint = 18
# define the time step (how often the controller will run)
dt = 0.1

# initialize the error, integral, and derivative terms
error = 0
integral = 0
derivative = 0

while True:
    # measure the current temperature
    temperature = measure_temperature()

    # calculate the error
    error = setpoint - temperature

    # update the integral term
    integral += error

    # calculate the derivative of the error
    derivative = (error - previous_error)/dt
    previous_error = error

    # calculate the output of the PID controller
    output = (Kp * error) + (Ki * integral) + (Kd * derivative)

    # adjust the heating system based on the output of the PID controller
    adjust_heating_system(output)

    # wait for a short time before measuring the temperature again
    time.sleep(dt)
```

In this example, the PID controller measures the temperature of the heating system every 0.1 seconds and calculates the error, integral, and derivative terms. It then uses these terms to calculate the output of the controller, which is used to adjust the heating system. By continuously updating the error, integral, and derivative terms, the controller can maintain the temperature of the heating system at the desired setpoint.

This is a very simple example of a PID controller, but it illustrates the basic principles of how a PID controller works. In practice, PID controllers are often more complex and may include additional features, such as anti-windup and saturation limits, to improve their performance and stability.

<details> 
  <summary>Click for Answers </summary>
   1.3a solution: A PD controller uses the proportional and derivative terms, but a PID controller uses all three terms. A PD has no way to eliminate steady state error, but a PID controller can eliminate steady state error by using the integral term.  
   <br>
   1.3b solution: A PD controller is appropriate when the system being controlled is very fast and the proportional term is sufficient to eliminate the steady state error. As an example an inverted pendulum system can be controlled with a PD controller if you want to balance it perfectly upright.
