# Robotics IIb: Practical Control Examples
## Open AI Gym Primer

Open AI Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It supports teaching agents everything from walking to playing games like Pong or Pinball. The three main functions used to interact with a gym environment are:

- `env.reset()`: Resets the environment and returns the initial state.
- `env.step(action)`: Executes the given action and returns the next state, reward, and whether the episode is done.
- `env.render()`: Renders the environment.

## Applied Example - Pendulum PID Control

The CartPole environment is a simulation of a pole attached to a cart. The goal of the agent is to balance the pole on the cart. The agent receives a reward of 1 for every step that the pole is balanced on the cart. The agent receives a reward of 0 if the pole falls over. The agent receives a reward of -1 if the pole falls over and the cart moves more than 2.4 units away from the center of the track. 

Below is some Python code to implement PID control to solve the pendulum environment. 

```python
import gym
import numpy as np
import time

env = gym.make('Pendulum-v1', g=4)
obs = env.reset()
dt = 0.025
# PID control parameters
kp = 0.1
ki = 0
kd = 0.01
# PID control variables
integral_error = 0
previous_error = 0
setpoint = 0

for t in range(10000):
    env.render()
    angle = np.rad2deg(np.arccos(obs[0]))
    if obs[1] < 0:
        angle = -angle
    error = setpoint - angle
    integral_error += error
    derivative_error = (error - previous_error)/dt
    previous_error = error
    action = (error * kp + integral_error * ki + derivative_error * kd)
    action = np.clip(action, -2, 2)
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step([action])
    time.sleep(dt)
    print('angle: ', np.round(angle), 'action: ', np.round(action, 2), 'error: ', np.round(error,2))

    if done:
        obs = env.reset()
```
