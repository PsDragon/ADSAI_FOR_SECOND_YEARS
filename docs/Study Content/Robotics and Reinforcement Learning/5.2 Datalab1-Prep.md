# Datalab Prep: Balancing an Inverted Pendulum

For tomorrows datalab you will be implementing a controller on a robot arm in the RoboSuite environment. As preparation for this we will first implement a controller for a simple inverted pendulum. This will give you a chance to practice implementing a controller in a simple environment before moving on to the more complex RoboSuite environment.

## Task

Initialize the inverted pendulum environment with `g=2`

```python
env = gym.make('Pendulum-v1', g=2)
```

1. Implement a controller for the inverted pendulum environment. The controller should be able to balance the pendulum upright.

    * Try using only P control
    * Try using only PD control

2. Implement a controller for the inverted pendulum environment. The controller should be able to balance the pendulum at 90<sup>o</sup> from the horizontal.

    * Try using only P control
    * Try using only PD control
    * Try using only PID control

3. Now use the pid controller implemented [here](https://github.com/ivmech/ivPID) and compare your results. This controller has upgrades like anti-windup.

Note: The below challenges are optional. They are meant to give you a chance to practice the concepts you learned in this module. If you are having trouble with the main task, you can skip these challenges and come back to them later.

Control Challenges: <img src="Images/challenge.png" height="50" />

- Try to get the pendulum to swing upright and balance with gravity set to 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Hint: You will need to use some logic to swing the pendulum up before the PID controller will work to balance the pendulum.
- Try to Implement integral clamping to prevent the integral windup problem. Does it make a difference to the performance of the controller in this case?

Coding Challenge: <img src="Images/challenge.png" height="50" />
- Create a PID class that can be used to control the inverted pendulum. The class should have a constructor that takes in the gains for the proportional, integral, and derivative terms. The class should also have a method that takes in the current state of the system and returns the control input. You can add any other methods you think would be helpful. You can use the code below as a starting point.

```python
class PID:
    def __init__(self, ):


    def calc_ouput(self, ):

```

- Create a controller that uses your PID class to control the inverted pendulum.
