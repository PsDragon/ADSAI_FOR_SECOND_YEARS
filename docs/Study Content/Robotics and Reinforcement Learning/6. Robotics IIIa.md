# Robotic Simulation: RoboSuite Basics

RoboSuite is a Python library for simulating robotic systems. It is based on the MuJoCo physics engine, and is designed to be easy to use and extend. RoboSuite is a part of the D4RL project, which is a collection of datasets and benchmarks for deep reinforcement learning in robotics. 

## Installation

To install RoboSuite, run the following command:

```bash
pip install robosuite
```

## Getting Started

To get started, we will use RoboSuite to simulate a robotic arm lifting a block. The code for this example is in the file `block_lift.py`.

### Importing RoboSuite

To use RoboSuite, we first need to import it. We will also import some other libraries that we will use later.

```python
import robosuite as suite
import robosuite.utils.transform_utils as T
import numpy as np
```

### Creating an Environment

To create an environment, we use the `make` function. The first argument is the name of the environment. The second argument is the `has_renderer` argument, which determines whether or not to render the environment. The third argument is the `has_offscreen_renderer` argument, which determines whether or not to render the environment in an offscreen window. The fourth argument is the `use_camera_obs` argument, which determines whether or not to use camera observations. The fifth argument is the `control_freq` argument, which determines the control frequency of the environment. The sixth argument is the `horizon` argument, which determines the length of the episode. The seventh argument is the `ignore_done` argument, which determines whether or not to ignore the `done` signal from the environment. The eighth argument is the `camera_names` argument, which determines which cameras to use. The ninth argument is the `camera_heights` argument, which determines the height of the cameras. The tenth argument is the `camera_widths` argument, which determines the width of the cameras. The eleventh argument is the `camera_depths` argument, which determines the depth of the cameras. The twelfth argument is the `reward_shaping` argument, which determines whether or not to use reward shaping. The thirteenth argument is the `control_mode` argument, which determines the control mode of the environment. The fourteenth argument is the `time_limit` argument, which determines the time limit of the environment. The fifteenth argument is the `device_id` argument, which determines the device ID of the environment. The sixteenth argument is the `use_object_obs` argument, which determines whether or not to use object observations. The seventeenth argument is the `use_camera_obs` argument, which determines whether or not to use camera observations. The eighteenth argument is the `use_indicator_object_obs` argument, which determines whether or not to use indicator object observations. The nineteenth argument is the `use_image_obs` argument, which determines whether or not to use image observations. The twentieth argument is the `use_force_torque` argument, which determines whether or not to use force torque observations. The twenty-first argument is the `use_visual_obs` argument, which determines whether or not to use visual observations. The twenty-second argument is the `use_collision_obs` argument, which determines whether or not to use collision observations. The twenty-third argument is the `use_indicator_collision

```python
env = suite.make(
    "Lift",
    has_renderer=True,
    has_offscreen_renderer=False,
    use_camera_obs=False,
    control_freq=20,
    horizon=1000,
    ignore_done=True,
    camera_names="frontview",
    camera_heights=256,
    camera_widths=256,
    camera_depths=False,
    reward_shaping=True,
    control_mode="position",
    time_limit=10,
    device_id=0,
    use_object_obs=True,
    use_indicator_object_obs=True,
    use_image_obs=False,
    use_force_torque=False,
    use_visual_obs=False,
    use_collision_obs=False,
    use_indicator_collision_obs=False,
)
```
