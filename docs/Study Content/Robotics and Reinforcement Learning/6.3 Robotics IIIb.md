# Robotic Simulation: Advanced RoboSuite

RoboSuite is a Python library for simulating robotic systems. It is based on the MuJoCo physics engine, and is designed to be easy to use and extend. RoboSuite is a part of the D4RL project, which is a collection of datasets and benchmarks for deep reinforcement learning in robotics. 

## Wrappers

## Add Cameras

## Add Objects

## Adjust OSC pos parameters

## URDF Files

A URDF file is an XML file that describes the structure of a robot. It is used by the ROS (Robot Operating System) to describe the structure of a robot. It is also used by the RoboSuite library to describe the structure of a robot.
