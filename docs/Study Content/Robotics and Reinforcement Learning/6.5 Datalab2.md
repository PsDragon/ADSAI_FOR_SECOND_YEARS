# Block Stacking and Bin Picking in RoboSuite

## Goal for the day:

- Use the RoboSuite environment to simulate a robotic arm stacking blocks and picking up blocks from a bin. Analyze the performance of your controller.

## Expected Output

- A gif of a robot arm lifting a block and stacking it on top of another block
- A gif of a robot arm picking up a series of objects from a table and placing them in corresponding bins
- A basic performance analysis of the two controllers

## General Plan:
- [ ] Discuss any questions about the knowledge modules so far
- [ ] Address any outstanding points from the previous datalab
- [ ] Discuss plan for controlling the robotic arm
- [ ] Use the RoboSuite environment to simulate a robotic arm stacking blocks, using a controller that you design.
- [ ] Use the RoboSuite environment to simulate a robotic arm picking up a series of objects from a table and placing them in corresponding bins, using a controller that you design.
- [ ] Analyze the performance of your controllers
