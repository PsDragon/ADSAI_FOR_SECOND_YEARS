## What is RL?

As mentioned in the videos, reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning that is concerned with how agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. The agent receives a reward for each action it takes, and the goal is to maximize the total reward over some time period. The agent does not know which actions will yield the most reward, and must discover this through trial and error. 

To put it another way, the reinforcement learning problem is a type of machine learning problem where an agent learns to take actions in an environment in order to maximize a reward signal. In this problem, the agent is faced with a sequence of decisions and must choose the action that will maximize its expected reward. This problem is often used in applications where an agent must learn to take actions based on its observations of the environment, such as in games, robotics, and control systems. The goal of reinforcement learning is to develop algorithms that can learn to take optimal actions in a wide range of environments and tasks.

</div>

Reinforcement learning is different from supervised learning in that the agent does not receive a label for each action it takes. There is no pre-existing labelled dataset that links observations to action. The agent is essentially creating its own 'dataset' of states, actions, and rewards through interacting with the environment and the learning from this data (learning from experience). This can be considered as semi-supervised learning, where the agent is given a reward signal but not a label for each action it takes. The reward function is the supervisor that tells the agent whether it is doing a good job or not.

## RL Applications and Milestones

Reinforcement learning has been used to solve a wide range of problems in a variety of domains. It was first introduced in the 1950s, but it was not until the 1990s that it was applied to real-world problems. The rise of deep learning in the 2010s has led to a resurgence of interest in reinforcement learning, with deep reinforcement learning algorithms now being used to solve a wide range of problems in robotics, games, and other domains.

### Milestones in the history of reinforcement learning:

- 1950: The inception of the field - The foundation of reinforcement learning was laid by mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing, who proposed the idea of a "learning machine" in his 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence."

</div>

Control systems: Reinforcement learning has been used to develop control algorithms for systems such as power grids and traffic networks, where the goal is to optimize the behavior of the system based on observations of the environment. For example, reinforcement learning has been used to develop algorithms that can learn to optimize the routing of traffic in a network of roads in order to minimize congestion and maximize the flow of vehicles. Reinforcement learning has been used to develop algorithms that can learn to control the behavior of IoT devices, such as smart home appliances and wearable devices. For example, researchers at Google used reinforcement learning to develop an algorithm that could learn to control the energy consumption of smart thermostats in order to reduce electricity usage and save money.

Natural language processing: Reinforcement learning has been used to develop algorithms for natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation and dialogue systems. For example, researchers at OpenAI used reinforcement learning to develop a machine translation algorithm that could learn to translate text from one language to another without the need for large amounts of labeled data. Most recently RL has been used in the training of large language models like GPT-3.5 that was used to create [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat).

Autonomous vehicles: Reinforcement learning has been used to develop algorithms that can learn to control autonomous vehicles, such as cars and drones. For example, researchers at NVIDIA used reinforcement learning to develop a self-driving car that could learn to navigate through a city using a camera and lidar sensors. Tesla and Comma AI are also exploring reinforcement learning to develop algorithms as a part of their self-driving car systems.

Healthcare: Reinforcement learning has been used to develop algorithms that can learn to make decisions in healthcare, such as recommending treatments for patients. For example, [researchers at the University of California, Berkeley used reinforcement learning](https://biosciences.lbl.gov/2022/07/22/researchers-at-berkeley-lab-advance-cancer-research-using-artificial-intelligence/) to develop an algorithm that could learn to recommend cancer treatments based on observations of the patient's medical history and test results.

Personalization: Reinforcement learning has been used to develop algorithms that can learn to personalize experiences for users, such as recommending products or content. These are known as recommender systems. For example, researchers at Amazon used reinforcement learning to develop an algorithm that could learn to recommend products to users based on their past purchases and browsing history.

Supply chain optimization: Reinforcement learning has been used to develop algorithms that can learn to optimize the flow of goods in a supply chain, such as scheduling the production of goods and the routing of trucks. For example, researchers at Alibaba used reinforcement learning to develop an algorithm that could learn to optimize the scheduling of shipments in a supply chain network in order to minimize delays and maximize efficiency.

Financial trading: Reinforcement learning can be used to develop algorithms that can learn to trade financial instruments, such as stocks and bonds. RL can be used to develop trading strategies that maximize returns or minimize risk. For example, an RL model could be trained to analyze market data and make decisions about when to buy or sell stocks based on the predicted returns or risks of different actions. RL has the potential to be a powerful tool in finance, as it can enable automated decision making that is faster and more flexible than traditional methods. However, like any machine learning algorithm, RL models are only as good as the data and assumptions that they are trained on, so it is important to carefully consider the limitations and potential biases of any RL model used in finance. Additionally, the use of RL in finance is an active area of research, and it is likely that new developments and applications in this field will continue to emerge in the future.
