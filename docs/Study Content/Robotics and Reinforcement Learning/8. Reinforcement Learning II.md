# RL II: Applying RL WORK IN PROGRESS

In this module we will learn about applying reinforcement learning to solve robotic tasks.

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

### Basics
### Spaces - Action & Observation
### Custom Environment Wrappers

You can make almost any environment into a gym environment by wrapping it in a gym environment wrapper. This is useful if you want to use a custom environment with a reinforcement learning algorithm, or if you want to modify the environment in some way. Like changing the reward function or done condition.

## Stable Baselines 3	

Stable Baselines 3 is a set of improved implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms based on PyTorch. It is a fork of Stable Baselines, a set of improved implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms based on TensorFlow. It provides a high-level interface for RL algorithms such as DQN, SAC, PPO, A2C, and TRPO. It also includes implementations of common helper functions such as replay buffers, policies, and value functions.
