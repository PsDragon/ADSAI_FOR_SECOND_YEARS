# PID with Vision

## Goal for the day:

- Develop a vision system using object detection to estimate the position of a cube in a 3D environment.
- Integrate the PID controller with the vision system to control the position of the end effector of the robotic arm.

### Expected Output

- A gif of a robot arm lifting a block, with vision data overlayed on the image

## General Plan:
- [ ] Discuss any questions about the knowledge modules so far
- [ ] Collect training data for co-ordinate estimation
- [ ] Train a model to estimate the position of the cube
- [ ] Use the RoboSuite environment to simulate a robotic arm lifting a block, using a controller that you design that uses the vision system to estimate the position of the cube.
