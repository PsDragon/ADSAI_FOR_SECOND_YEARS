# PID with Vision

## Goal for the day:

- Develop a vision system using object detection to estimate the position of a cube in a 3D environment.
- Integrate the PID controller with the vision system to control the position of the end effector of the robotic arm.

### Expected Output

- A gif of a robot arm lifting a block, with vision data overlayed on the image

## General Plan:
- [ ] Discuss any questions about the knowledge modules so far
- [ ] Collect training data for co-ordinate estimation
- [ ] Train a model to estimate the position of the cube
- [ ] Use the RoboSuite environment to simulate a robotic arm lifting a block, using a controller that you design that uses the vision system to estimate the position of the cube.

## Estimating the Position of a cube in a 3D Environment (Coming Soon!)

### Collecting Training Data

### Creating a Model

- Create a model class that inherits from `nn.Module`
- Define the layers of the model
- Define the forward pass

### Training a Model

- Zero gradients
- Forward pass one batch
- Calculate loss
- Backward pass, update weights
- Step the optimizer
- Update weights
- Repeat until all batches have been processed
- Repeat for all epochs

### Using the Model

- Load the model
- Set the model to evaluation mode
- Run the model on an data from RoboSuite and your object detection algorithm
- Use the predicted position as an input to your PID controller
