# 1. Statistical Inference: A Primer

As a Machine Learning expert, you are familiar with how to build models that do a good job at **predicting** outcomes, however, understanding more about how the world works and making good decisions based on such understanding, requires more than just ML and AI.

Data Scientists specializing in inference design experiments, test hypotheses, and perform causal inference in order to figure out what factors are driving outcomes.

The focus of this knowledge module is on understanding the principles behind hypothesis testing.
