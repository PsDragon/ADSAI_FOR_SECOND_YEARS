# 1. Statistical Inference: A Primer

As a Machine Learning expert, you are familiar with how to build models that do a good job at **predicting** outcomes, however, **explaining** and understanding more about how the world works and making good decisions based on such understanding, requires more than just ML and AI.

Data Scientists specializing in inference design experiments, test hypotheses, and perform causal inference in order to figure out what factors are driving outcomes.

The focus of this knowledge module is on understanding the principles behind hypothesis testing.

After this module, you will be able to:
- [ ] Develop and understanding of statistical inference and hypothesis testing.
- [ ] Conduct statistical tests for correlation coefficients.
- [ ] Conduct a z-test and t-test using R.
- [ ] Conduct a one-way and two-way ANOVA using R.
- [ ] Communicate uncertainity in findings using p-values and confidence intervals.

Or equivalently, after this module, this video will make perfect sense!

## To explain or to predict

 Kindly spend a few minutes watching this talk to understand the distinction between explanatory and predictive modelling. Then answer the questions (~500 words) that follow; upload your answers to Github.

1. What is the difference between predictive and explanatory modelling?
2. Should a model that can explain well, also have good predictive accuracy?
3. In the world of Big Data, AI, and data-driven predictive modelling, are explanations even relevant?
4. Can you provide an example of a use-case where prediction is more important than explanation, and vice-versa?

## Why do we need inference?

Statistical inference, stripped down to it's basic elements, is all about making decisions in the face of uncertain information.
In practice, the uncertainity is often a result of making claims about a population, but from a sample drawn from the population.
Please watch the following video to understand the distinction between a sample and a population.

As we progress through this module, we will become familiar with techniques that allow us to make confident claims about a population, based on a sample!
But first, we need to become familiar with the tools of the trade - namely R (download [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)).

## R programming refresher

The R language for statistical computing is widely used in the data science industry for inference and hypothesis testing.
In order to refresh your R skills, please refer the the course below and attach an evidence of completion to your learning logs.

- [DataCamp - Introduction to R](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/free-introduction-to-r)

If you feel you could use a harder challenge, start with the intermediate course:
- [DataCamp - Intermediate R](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-r)

For data visualisation needs, look-up ```ggplot2```.

## Assignment

### Titanic data investigation using Pandas.

In this exercise, you will use R ```data.table``` to investigate the Titanic
dataset to answer the following questions:

- [ ] Which class had a higher chance of surviving the disaster?
- [ ] Which gender has a higher change of surviving the disaster?
- [ ] Group the data into age groups (young, adult, old) and find which age group
had the highest chance of surviving?

> Note: Use https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data to download and explore the dataset.

> Only read in train.csv
