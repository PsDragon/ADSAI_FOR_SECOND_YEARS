# 2. Foundations of Probability 

Probability is the study of randomess. It deals with the chance (sometimes referred as the likelihood) of an discrete event occurring. For example, if you toss a fair coin four times (where each coin toss is one discrete event), the outcomes may not be two heads and two tails. However, if you toss the same coin 4,000 times, the outcomes will be close to 2000 heads and 2000 tails. Please watch the following video to understand this concept.
