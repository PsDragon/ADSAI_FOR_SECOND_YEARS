## __Foundations of AI (2): Symbolic/non-symbolic AI & Intelligent agents__

### 1. Introduction
\
Today's independent study material focusses on the concept of symbolic/non-symbolic AI, and intelligent agents. You will approximately spend 4 hours on the material. We advise you to work on your first draft of the creative brief for the remainder of the day.

### 2. Symbolic AI vs. non-symbolic AI
\


__2a__ Watch the video on symbolic AI by the YouTube channel CrashCourse.

__2b__ define the term 'expert system'.

__2c__ Are artificial neural networks similar to the human brain?  Support your answer with arguments.

__2d__ A artificial neural network uses a a) symbolic or b) non-symbolic approach to AI? Select one of the options, and explain
your choice.

__2e__ Can you think of a scenario where an AI method that uses a symbolic approach would be more suited than a method
that uses a non-symbolic approach? Explain your answer.

### 3. Intelligent agents
\
__3a__ Read chapter 3 of AIMA (p.96-140).

__3b__ Watch the video on Deep Blue by IBM.

*Video 2. Deep Blue*

__5c__ IBM's Deep Blue uses a a) symbolic or b) non-symbolic approach to AI? Select one of the options, and explain your
choice.

__5d__ Two intelligent agents are playing chess with a clock. One of them is called 'Deep Blue', while the other
is called Gary Kasparov. Roughly specify the task environment for Deep Blue (this means you will have to specifying each letter in PEAS), and determine each of the following properties of this task environment:

1. a) Fully observable or b) partially observable
2. a) Deterministic or b) stochastic
3. a) Episodic or b) sequential
4. a) Static, b) dynamic or c) semi-dynamic
5. a) Discrete or b) continuous
6. a) Single agent or b) multi-agent

Explain your answer.

__5e__ Provide an example of an intelligent agent, and give a PEAS description of the task
environment, and characterize it in terms of the properties listed in Section 2.3.2 (p. 117) in AIMA.
