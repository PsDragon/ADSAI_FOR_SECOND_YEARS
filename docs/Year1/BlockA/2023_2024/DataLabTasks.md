## Task 1: Presentation on AI in Science Fiction

For this task, which is related to ILO 3.1, you will be asked to give a 7-minute presentation in Week 3, DataLab II, where you identify, and describe an AI topic in the movie Minority Report, and place it within the Taxonomy of AI (i.e. domains, and subdomains). In addition, you will need to evaluate the technical feasibility of the AI topic by critically assessing its possible application(s) within a real-life (business) setting. Furthermore, you will need to articulate potential ethical and/or legal implications of the AI application. Lastly, in order to meet the information needs for the Minority Report presentation, you will need to acquire, evaluate, and use information from various popular and/or scholarly sources, such as blogs and scientific journal articles. 

### To solve this task, you will need to:

:point_right: __Identify, and describe an AI topic within the movie Minority Report, and connect it to the relevant domain(s), and subdomain(s) of the Taxonomy of AI__

- [ ] Watch the movie Minority Report or familiarize yourself with its plot and key elements. Take note of any instances where AI technologies, methods, and/or practices are depicted or mentioned. 
- [ ] Find more information about the AI technologies, methods, and/or practices that you identified in the movie. [Google](https://www.google.com/) is often a good starting point. Other useful sources: [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/), [Nature](https://www.nature.com/), [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/), and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/international). Do not restrict yourself to one source; try looking for multiple sources to back findings and arguments.
- [ ] Choose one AI topic from the move that you find interesting, and describe it in your own words. Make sure that you describe it such a way that an AI researcher, but also your non-technical grandmother, can understand it.
- [ ] In order to successfully connect your chosen AI topic to relevant domain(s) and subdomain(s) of the Taxonomy of AI, you need to carefully read the GitHub page [Taxonomy of AI II & State-of-the-art AI](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Artificial%20Intelligence/Week3Day1.html). Keep in mind that you can have multiple domains and subdomains for one specific AI topic. For example, the AI topic 'video summarization' using a deep learning based algorithm can be classified under the domains 'Perception' and 'Learning', and the subdomains 'Computer Vision' and 'Machine Learning'.

:point_right: __Provide one example of an AI application within a real-life (business) setting that is related to your chosen AI topic__

For instance, let us say the chosen AI topic is 'Natural Language Processing (NLP)'. 

- [ ] Look for case studies, articles, or reports that highlight the successful implementation of NLP in a business context. This could include applications such as chatbots, sentiment analysis, or language translation. 

:point_right: __An annotated reference list is provided at the end of the presentation. To meet the 'Good' criteria of ILO 3.1, you need to include at least one scholarly source in your presentation__

- [ ] Create an annotated reference list to acknowledge the sources you used during your research. Preferably, using a referencing style, such as APA or IEEE. Note: there is a difference between so called in-text, and bibliography citations. 
- [ ] You can use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) or [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) to manage your references and create a reference list according to a specific referencing style.

:point_right: __Evaluate the technical feasibility of the AI topic by critically assessing its application within a real-life (business) setting__

Basically, we will try to answer the following question, keeping our chosen AI topic in mind:

<video src="./queen.mp4" controls="controls" style="max-width: 365px;">
</video>

Step-by-step, this means we need to:

- [ ] Learn as much about your chosen AI topic as possible. This includes its current capabilities, its limitations, and the technological advancements it might require to function effectively in your chosen setting.

:bell: Two Minute Papers is a great way to get a quick overview of the state-of-the-art AI research. Check out the [Two Minute Papers YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/keeroyz) for inspiration.

- [ ] Assess what kind of infrastructure would be needed to support this AI application. Consider factors like data storage, computational resources, necessary hardware, network capabilities, and software compatibility. If the infrastructure needs are too high or expensive, the application may not be technically feasible.
- [ ] Consider the level of technical expertise required to implement and maintain the AI technology. This involves not just the initial development and deployment, but also ongoing support, troubleshooting, and potential updates. If there is a shortage of professionals skilled in this specific AI technology, it could hinder the feasibility.
- [ ] Think about how well this AI technology could integrate with existing systems in the chosen business setting. If the integration process would be too complex or disruptive, this could affect the feasibility of the AI technology.
- [ ] Examine how reliable the AI technology is. Is it consistent in its operations? How well does it perform under different conditions? Unreliable or underperforming technology could lead to issues in a real-life business setting.
- [ ] Take into account the costs of developing, implementing, maintaining, and potentially upgrading the AI technology. These costs should be weighed against the projected benefits and returns the technology is expected to provide. For inspiration, check out the UPenn blog post [The hidden costs of AI: Impending energy and resource strain](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/hidden-costs-ai-impending-energy-and-resource-strain)

:point_right: __Articulate the potential ethical and/or legal consequences of implementing the chosen AI topic in a real-life (business) setting__

*Video 1. How the AI revolution disrupts societies.*

- [ ] Identify the potential ethical issues related to your chosen AI application. Some possible ethical issues could include bias in decision-making, privacy concerns, transparency in how the AI reaches its decisions, and the potential for [job loss](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-023-05339-7) due to automation.

AND/OR

- [ ] Identify the potential legal issues related to your chosen AI application. This could involve understanding the various laws and regulations related to data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and non-discrimination that are applicable in the jurisdiction(s) where your AI application will be used. Within an EU/Dutch context, you could consider the following laws and regulations:

    - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): This EU regulation protects the privacy and personal data of EU citizens. It requires organizations to inform users about how their data is used, enables users to access their data, and allows them to correct or delete their data. This applies even if your organization isn't based in the EU, but handles EU citizens' data.
    - Dutch Copyright Act (i.e., Auteurswet): If your AI application creates new content or uses existing copyrighted material, this law is relevant. The Dutch Copyright Act protects the rights of authors of literary, scientific, and artistic works.
    - Dutch Telecommunications Act (i.e., Telecommunicatiewet): If your AI application involves the processing of traffic or location data, the use of cookies, or direct marketing activities, you should review the relevant provisions in the Telecommunications Act.
    - Sector-Specific Regulations: Just like everywhere else, sector-specific regulations may apply. If your AI is used in healthcare, for example, you need to comply with the Dutch Medical Treatment Contracts Act (WGBO) and the Dutch Medical Devices Act (i.e., Wet medische hulpmiddelen).
