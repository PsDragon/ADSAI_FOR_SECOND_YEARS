## Task 3.1: Presentation on AI in Science Fiction

For this task, which is related to ILO 3.1, you will be asked to ... ETC. 

TEXT (IRENE)

### To solve this task, you will need to:

:point_right: __Identify, and describe an AI topic within the movie Minority Report, and connect it to the relevant domain(s), and subdomain(s) of the Taxonomy of AI__

- [ ] Watch the movie Minority Report or familiarize yourself with its plot and key elements. Take note of any instances where AI technologies, methods, and/or practices are depicted or mentioned. 
- [ ] Find more information about the AI technologies, methods, and/or practices that you identified in the movie. [Google](https://www.google.com/) is often a good starting point. Other useful sources: [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/), [Nature](https://www.nature.com/), [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/), and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/international). Do not restrict yourself to one source; try looking for multiple sources to back findings and arguments.
- [ ] Choose one AI topic from the move that you find interesting, and describe it in your own words. Make sure that you describe it such a way that an AI researcher, but also your non-technical grandmother, can understand it.
- [ ] In order to successfully connect your chosen AI topic to relevant domain(s) and subdomain(s) of the Taxonomy of AI, you need to carefully read the GitHub page [Taxonomy of AI III](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Artificial%20Intelligence/Week3Day1.html). Keep in mind that you can have multiple domains and subdomains for one specific AI topic. For example, the AI topic 'video summarization' using a deep learning based algorithm can be classified under the domains 'Perception' and 'Learning', and the subdomains 'Computer Vision' and 'Machine Learning'.

:point_right: __Provide one example of an AI application within a real-life (business) setting that is related to your chosen AI topic__

For instance, let's say the chosen AI topic is 'Natural Language Processing (NLP)'. 

- [ ] Look for case studies, articles, or reports that highlight the successful implementation of NLP in a business context. This could include applications such as chatbots, sentiment analysis, or language translation. 

:point_right: __An annotated reference list is provided at the end of the presentation. To meet the 'Good' criteria of ILO 3.1, you need to include at least one scholarly source in your presentation__

- [ ] Create an annotated reference list to acknowledge the sources you used during your research. Preferably, using a referencing style, such as APA or IEEE. Note: there is a difference between so called in-text, and bibliography citations. 
- [ ] You can use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) or [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) to manage your references and create a reference list according to a specific referencing style.

:point_right: __Evaluate the technical feasibility of the AI topic by critically assessing its application within a real-life (business) setting__

- [ ] Find out what the relevant AI literature says about the technical feasibility of your chosen AI topic. For example, what are the limitations of the AI topic....
- [ ] TEXT (IRENE)

:point_right: __Articulate the potential ethical and/or legal consequences of implementing the chosen AI topic in a real-life (business) setting__

## Data science
To realize the project, the following tasks need to be completed:

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 4.1 Define a data-driven research question | You are expected to frame a data-driven research question related to a sustainable development goal. Questions can range from simple (e.g., how country X is performing on indicator Y) to complex (e.g., how country X is performing on indicator Y, and what are the key variables related to Y). Use SDGTracker to help formulate your problem statement. |
| 4.2 Gather accurate data from a relevant source | You are expected to use the Sustainable Development Goals databank in order to gather the appropriate dataset to answer your research question. Use SDGDataBank to collect the relevant data. |
| 4.3 Explore your data | You are expected to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) concepts learned in the workshops to your dataset. |
| 4.4 Analyse your data and visualize your findings | You are expected to apply concepts learned in the workshops and [generate appropriate visualisations](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Business%20Intelligence/images/chart_suggestion.jpg), which support your arguments towards answering the research question, in Power BI. Furthermore, you are expected to calculate and interpret at least 1 measure of association such as a correlation coefficient and it's effect size related to your research question. |
| 4.5 Supplement your solution to your research question with supporting arguments | You are expected to answer your research question with supporting arguments based on your analysis and the interpretation of your results to create a considerate picture of your research and provide recommendations for next steps. |
| 4.6 Present your findings to the client | Presenting your findings is important and requires you to think of an [intuitive user design (guidelines)](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/principles-visual-design/#:~:text=Summary%3A%20The%20principles%20of%20scale,increase%20usability%20when%20applied%20correctly.) to effectively convey your findings to the client. In DataLab 2, Week 7, you are expected to provide a live demo of your dashboard to the client, staff and your peers. Students, staff, and the client will be allowed to vote for the best dashboard. |



## Task 4.1 Define a data-driven research question: 

For this task, which is related to the 'Poor' criteria of ILO 4.2, you are expected to frame a data-driven research question related to a sustainable development goal. Questions can range from simple (e.g., how country X is performing on indicator Y) to complex (e.g., how country X is performing on indicator Y, and what are the key variables related to Y). Use SDGTracker to help formulate your problem statement.

TEXT (ALICAN)

### To solve this task, you will need to:
- [ ] Write a conclusion, which is a clear summary of the following:
1. A summary of the problem and research question 
2. The findings of the EDA
3. Your interpretation of the EDA
4. Considerations in your EDA/the data
5. Next steps for analysis; next CRISP-DM cycle

:point_right: __TEXT (ALICAN)__

Look at your dashboard and reconsider it's design; how it conveys information, and reconsider:

- [ ] Is the story I'm telling using my data and findings clear and compelling?
- [ ] Is the user experience of my dashboard fitting for the data story I'm trying to convey?

If not, which techniques can I use to achieve this end? - Note down how you iterate in your learning log!

- [ ] Finally, consider the CRISM-DM project lifecycle and how your project would progress given that model.

Are you finished with all the tasks, and still have time remaining, please have a look at the Medal Challenges!
