TEXT (IRENE)

## Use-case 1: Presentation on AI in Science Fiction

In this use-case, which is related to the 'Insufficient' criteria of ILO 3.1, you will be asked to ... ETC. 

TEXT (IRENE)

### To solve this use-case, you will need to:

:point_right: __Identify, and describe an AI topic within the movie Minority Report, and connect it to the relevant domain(s), and subdomain(s) of the Taxonomy of AI__

- [ ] Watch the movie Minority Report or familiarize yourself with its plot and key elements. Take note of any instances where AI technologies, methods, and/or practices are depicted or mentioned. 
- [ ] Find more information about the AI technologies, methods, and/or practices that you identified in the movie. [Google](https://www.google.com/) is often a good starting point. Other useful sources: [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/), [Nature](https://www.nature.com/), [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/), and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/international). Do not restrict yourself to one source; try looking for multiple sources to back findings and arguments.
- [ ] Choose one AI topic from the move that you find interesting, and describe it in your own words. Make sure that you describe it such a way that an AI researcher, but also your non-technical grandmother, can understand it.
- [ ] In order to successfully connect your chosen AI topic to relevant domain(s) and subdomain(s) of the Taxonomy of AI, you need to carefully read the GitHub page [Taxonomy of AI III](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Artificial%20Intelligence/Week3Day1.html). Keep in mind that you can have multiple domains and subdomains for one specific AI topic. For example, the AI topic 'video summarization' using a deep learning based algorithm can be classified under the domains 'Perception' and 'Learning', and the subdomains 'Computer Vision' and 'Machine Learning'.

:point_right: __Provide one example of an AI application within a real-life (business) setting that is related to your chosen AI topic__

For instance, let's say the chosen AI topic is 'Natural Language Processing (NLP)'. 

- [ ] Look for case studies, articles, or reports that highlight the successful implementation of NLP in a business context. This could include applications such as chatbots, sentiment analysis, or language translation. 

:point_right: __An annotated reference list is provided at the end of the presentation. To meet the 'Good' criteria of ILO 3.1, you need to include at least one scholarly source in your presentation__

- [ ] Create an annotated reference list to acknowledge the sources you used during your research. Preferably, using a referencing style, such as APA or IEEE. Note: there is a difference between so called in-text, and bibliography citations. 
- [ ] You can use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) or [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) to manage your references and create a reference list according to a specific referencing style.

:point_right: __Evaluate the technical feasibility of the AI topic by critically assessing its application within a real-life (business) setting__

- [ ] Find out what the relevant AI literature says about the technical feasibility of your chosen AI topic. For example, what are the limitations of the AI topic....
- [ ] TEXT (IRENE)

:point_right: __Articulate the potential ethical and/or legal consequences of implementing the chosen AI topic in a real-life (business) setting__

- [ ] TEXT

## Plagiarism

Please note that plagiarism is a serious offense. You are encouraged to use the internet to help you with your analyses, but you must ensure that you cite your sources.
