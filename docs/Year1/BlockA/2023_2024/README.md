# Block A - Business Understanding

Block A, focusses on the first stage of the *__CRISP-DM__* process, known as *__Business Understanding__*. This phase entails acquiring a deep understanding of the business context and requirements. 

<img src="./CRISPDM.jpg" alt="CRISP DM phases" width="400"/>

*Figure 1. CRISP DM phases.*

During this phase, you will acquire the skills necessary to formulate a research question that can be addressed through data analysis. You will learn how to find, and collect appropriate data from relevant sources, explore and analyze the collected data, and visualize your findings effectively using the programming language Python and the dashboarding tool Power BI. By doing so, you will be able to propose a solution to your research question, substantiated by sound arguments derived from your analysis. Finally, you will gain proficiency in presenting your findings to the client in a clear and concise manner.

## Project Based Learning - Creative Brief

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were established by the United Nations in 2015 to guide countries in achieving a sustainable future. These 17 global objectives encompass a wide range of areas, including poverty eradication, education, gender equality, economic growth, climate action, and environmental protection.

The *__SDG Hub@BUas__*, referred to as the client, has reached out to you as an aspiring - *__data professional__* - to apply your expertise in providing data-driven solutions. In particular, they require your assistance in monitoring and assessing the advancements made towards the SDGs on a global and/or country-specific scale. 

<img src="./SDGTeam.jpg" alt="Team SGD Hub@BUas" width="400"/>

*Figure 2. Team SDG Hub@BUas.*

The objective is to *__develop an interactive dashboard utilizing your newly acquired skills in data analytics and visualization__*. The dashboard will provide valuable insights to policymakers, researchers, and activists, enabling them to make informed decisions and take targeted actions towards the SDGs. Moreover, it will serve as a tool to raise awareness among the general public, inspiring collective efforts towards creating a more sustainable and equitable world.

Good luck!

## Project Based Learning - Knowledge Modules

The ADS&AI program is structured into 8-week blocks. On Monday, Wednesday and Thursday you work individually on the development of fundamental skills, which are needed to successfully complete the Creative brief. In *__DataLab__* (Mandatory! See [DataLab Attendance & Preparation](ADD URL), for more information), scheduled on the Tuesday's and Friday's, you apply your knowledge to the Creative Brief by completing a list of tasks, which you can find [here](ADD URL). 

The block is further divided into two phases, centered around three *__knowledge modules__*:

- Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
- Introduction to Data Science (BRAM, NEEDs TO BE CHANGED?)
- Introduction to Python programming (ALICAN, NEEDS TO BE CHANGED?)

<img src="./BlockAFigure.png" alt="Block A, Year 1, Overview" width="600"/>

*Figure 3. Overview Block A, Year 1.*

### 1. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Week 1-3)

In the first three weeks of Block A, you will acquire foundational knowledge and understanding of the theories, principles, methods, and techniques related to the field of AI. For example, you will be made familiar with the philosophy, history, and taxonomy of AI, among others, by analysing the popular science fiction movie Minority Report. In addition, we will teach you essential soft skills, such as presenting and citing sources.

In DataLab II, Week 3, you are required to give a 7-minute presentation, where you identify, and describe an AI topic in this movie, and place it within the Taxonomy of AI. Furthermore, you will need to evaluate the technical feasibility of the AI topic by critically assessing its possible application(s) within a real-life (business) setting. Lastly, in order to meet the information needs for the 'AI in Science Fiction' presentation, you will need to acquire, evaluate, and use information from various popular and/or scholarly sources, such as blogs and scientific journal articles. Finally, for grading purposes, you will need to make a video recording of your presentation.  

### 2. Business Understanding & Reporting | Case Presentation (Week 4-7)

To change the world, we must first be able to measure it. Measuring and quantifying what matters is a crucial component of evaluating progress. In September 2015, all countries agreed to adopt specific goals as targets or indicators for global development. Collectively, these goals are known as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Many institutions, organizations and companies have decided to adopt these goals. One of them is BUas, it's aim is to become more sustainable as well; but how?

To figure this out, the SGD HUB of BUas, referred to as the client, has approached you as an aspiring data professional with an important task: to track and explore global, country-level or BUas-level progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this project, you will be involved in a series of tasks aimed at leveraging data to gain insights and provide solutions related to sustainable development. Your responsibilities include framing a data-driven research question, gathering accurate data from the Sustainable Development Goals databank, conducting exploratory data analysis, analyzing the data and visualizing the findings, and ultimately presenting your conclusions to the client. 

Throughout this process, you will be applying concepts and tools learned in workshops, such as SDGTracker for problem formulation and Power BI for visualization. The culmination of your efforts will be the presentation of your findings through an intuitive user interface, with a live demonstration of your dashboard to the client, staff, and peers. This presentation will also include an opportunity for everyone to vote on the best dashboard. Let's delve into the details of each step and embark on this meaningful journey towards understanding and promoting sustainable development.

This individual project [consists of the following steps]().

### 3. Introduction to Python programming (Weeks 1-8)
