# __Introduction to Artificial Intelligence & Digital Transformation__

## __Independent study material: Exercises__

### 1. Introduction
\
__1a__ Watch the TEDx talk 'Understanding Artificial Intelligence and Its Future' by
Neil Nie.

__1b__ Give three examples of AI applications. You can choose real-life examples,
but also examples from popular culture (e.g. movies, books, video games etc.).

***
### 2. Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence
\
__2a__ Read the first two sub-chapters of the book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Russell and Norvig (2020) (p.29-62).

Tip: if you cannot find the answer to a question in the provided literature, try to look for an answer online.
</div>   

__2b__ Define the following terms: 'Weak AI', and 'Strong AI'.
\
\
__2c__ What is the 'Chinese room experiment'? Describe its procedure.
\
\
__2d__ What is the 'Chinese room experiment' supposed to show? Select the correct statement, and elaborate on your choice:
\
\
a. *Computers are not yet able to simulate the human ability to understand*
\
b. *Understanding involves more than the ability to formally reproduce appropriate outputs*
\
c. *It is only possible for systems to demonstrate understanding*
\
d. *No machine can demonstrate genuine understanding*
\
\
__2e__ Connect the Post It notes (Fig 1.) to the relevant quadrant in the philosophy matrix (Fig 2.). For example, A = 1, 2, and  B = 3, 4, 5 etc.

### 3. History of Artificial Intelligence
\
__3a__ Watch the video on the History of AI by YouTube´s AI with Alex.

__3b__ Find, and describe one 'milestone' in the history of AI (maximum length of 100 words). Be creative, so no 'milestones' by Alan Turing! No worries, we are going to extensively discuss his accomplishments during the workshop in DataLab 1 :smiley:

***

### 4. Preparation for DataLab 1: Alan Turing & Chatbots, Minority Report screening
\
During DataLab 1, you will be given the opportunity to watch Minority Report (bring your own popcorn!). In addition, we will discuss a scientific article by Alan Turing, and perform the Turing test with the chatbots you, and your fellow students found online.

__4a__ Read the reading and video note taking guides.

__4b__ Who was Alan Turing? Write down your answer (maximum length of 150 words).

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #000000;; background-color: #FE9F8B; border-color: #FC3E16;">
Alert: whoever has the quirkiest fact on Alan Turing will receive a Mars bar at the end of DataLab 1.
</div>   

__4c__ Read Turing’s seminal work on AI: ['Computation Machinery and Intelligence'](https://watermark.silverchair.com/lix-236-433.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAqswggKnBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKYMIIClAIBADCCAo0GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMi0QU_r8XoVEcFqlmAgEQgIICXtQav8ZfX7wn3sMEOkUNL9dH5VzCvRC2RZmIy7W49sgHTbO69F9san7JvQmPOl81YMQ-3j26uRFGCiboiq7Ab4a4OSL5wtXnXaax9cWDFfrpTRJxWrVNnm8Yno9xXQyrZzJ7RYv1O7VIp4yIGTZvmE7sJuZ2etOCHfwY96_aMFjWAZH7TrUpPKvdY6E-lpyVeXcub5qrchiQHtXedsNatJJd3Y7eVlVwQfbgbLk3UcnQjWaWiDfHempRRjJUW-VGld4bpCBxAvFh5UVXzQm9B24ZFMljiGWJcvav9Qt70Vsu6VcYvx6rKfiKYSKHdpov6GNcCspnsOaVOVmkq66ZAElW5WMD4cZrmkfjTy435CLWORdIOlSJYX2jx7yHi-mV3Jifq0-ij-rRlnttSyodRch07QiU2G0GRKuN9fO9F7EOJtrvOurLEXwJcxaNL3Q4_3V82ffAmvtto5rzFLm0yuWjTG25kT-Hzzq6t4Z17g44vhddVWLZodCytpX8zQpiMnIpPIWCscluaLDDHhoCkY-dQGAzCqLDmC7yM1EuNHo1e99_6K5c8rZf7Yj_Suhzkn_WiTHO09mWW4V1dBHYiDpquaxPg0ENWywf3k7zMa68nqDrn4Aa4vkHHmftIRWkUDft8jjiyGx35bYma10yge1JJNzmSykqjwpTuKRKyhx-aQcYLcKVei5VjSEC4qrEn93N3KQ0FqWBb8YVhtxFhE7Suro5dyr5E9pz3T-OPHBxfImev3B_nZntI6YFihOorG7WuQlAh60yXOcCBHucubn9LuqCTTlEP9RsbnJgig.). Take notes!

__4b__ Watch video on chatbots and virtual agents by Angela Wick.

__4b__ Find a general purpose chatbot that is accessible via a weblink, and answer the following questions:

- When was it created?
- Who created it?
- Why was it created?

It is important to include evidence of your findings (e.g. webpage link of chatbot, newspaper article, academic
journal article etc.). When you cite your sources, use [APA Citation Guide](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/reference_list_basic_rules.html).

__4c__ Explain what the Loebner Prize is (maximum length of 100 words).
