*__By the end of this block, and having completed the relevant readings and activities, you should be able to:__*  

Learning Outcomes:

- identify, and analyze AI applications in fictional, and real life scenarios by examining and applying relevant concepts from AI literature and theory
- demonstrate an understanding of how AI is applied in different sectors of the economy
- recognize opportunities in applying AI to transform existing businesses
- report on thoughts and findings 

Knowledge & Understanding Objectives: 

- demonstrate basic knowledge about the field’s landscape by giving examples of AI applications
- identify and compare the four approaches to defining AI systems 
- list and describe closely related disciplines 
- explain the basic structure, working and organisation of biological neurons, and relate it to a neural network 
- identify and describe the major periods in the history of AI 
- describe the working, and limitations of the Turing Test/Imitation Game 
- list examples of both the benefits and risks associated with AI 
- list the defining characteristics of an intelligent agent 
- provide examples of agents and their corresponding PEAS (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) descriptions
- identify and describe the main properties of task environments 
- understand and differentiate between the four (basic) kinds of agent program

Learning & Research Objectives: 

- effectively read and summarize (academic) documentation 

### __Schedule__

The course has a study load of 36 hours per week. Two workshops of two hours are held each week in the DataLab. The rest of the time you will spend on independent/group study, either at home or in the DataLab.

__Week 1__

|  Day | Topic(s)   |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|  Monday | Self-study 1: The Foundations of Artificial Intelligence   |
|  Tuesday | Workshop 1: AI in Science (Fiction), Minority Report |
| Wednesday | Self-study 2: Turing Test & Chatbots |
| Thursday | Self-study 3: Turing Test & Chatbots  |
| Friday  | Workshop 2: Turing Test & Chatbots |

### __Creative Brief__

Students are required to create a professional report of maximum 3000 words (excl. cover/table of content/list of 
references, and appendices) on AI and Science Fiction using academic style of writing. For the report, students are 
expected to analyse Minority Report, which is a movie that uses AI as an integral part of the 
plot. In the report, you will describe the plot, and the role played by AI; analyse the author(s)’ concept of AI and 
conclude by discussing the feasibility of this concept. Additionally, the report needs to contain a novel case of how 
this, or a similar AI concept as in the movie can applied in a company, business, or organization. 

__Deliverables__
- First draft of report: cite its dominant AI theme(s), and outline the review 
- Final report
