## __Workshop 1: AI in Science (Fiction), Minority Report__

Today, we will start working on the final assignment of AI&DT: AI & Science (Fiction). A detailed description can be 
found in the creative brief. 

***

### __Creative Brief__

Students are required to create a professional report of maximum 3000 words (excl. cover/table of content/list of 
references, and appendices) on AI and Science Fiction using academic style of writing. For the report, students are 
expected to analyse Minority Report, which is a movie that uses AI as an integral part of the 
plot. In the report, you will describe the plot, and the role played by AI; analyse the author(s)â€™ concept of AI and 
conclude by discussing the feasibility of this concept. Additionally, the report needs to contain a novel case of how 
this, or a similar AI concept as in the movie can applied in a company, business, or organization. 

__Deliverables__
- First draft of report: cite its dominant AI theme(s), and outline the review 
- Final report

During the day, you will be given the opportunity to watch Minority Report in the DataLab (bring your own popcorn!).
There will be three screenings, timeslots are listed below: 

- 9:00 - 11:00

Tip: if you take notes during the movie, it will be easier to identify all the relevant AI concepts. For note taking 
strategies, visit <"http://kortschakcenter.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Video-Note-taking.pdf">[2]</a>.
