# Introduction To Data Science
Hello, welcomd to Data Science 1. Bla bla blah.

## 0) Watch or attend the opening lecture

## 1) Get R
In order to run swirl, you must have R 3.1.0 or later installed on your computer. 
If you need to install R, you can do so here: 
- https://cran.rstudio.com/

For help installing R, check out one of the following videos (courtesy of Roger Peng at Johns Hopkins Biostatistics):
- Installing R on Windows: https://youtu.be/mfGFv-iB724
- Installing R on Mac: https://youtu.be/Icawuhf0Yqo

## 2) Get R-Studio
In addition to R, it’s highly recommended that you install RStudio, which will make your experience with R much more enjoyable.
If you need to install RStudio, you can do so here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Select the appropriate installer for your operating system.

## 3) Install swirl
Open RStudio (or just plain R if you don't have RStudio) and type the following into the console:
```R
	> install.packages("swirl")
```

Note that the > symbol at the beginning of the line is R's prompt for you type something into the console. We include it here so you know that this command is to be typed into the console and not elsewhere. The part you type begins after >.

## 4) Start swirl
This is the only step that you will repeat every time you want to run swirl. First, you will load the package using the library() function. Then you will call the function that starts the magic! Type the following, pressing Enter after each line:
```R
	> library("swirl")
	> swirl()
```

## 5) Install the DS1-course
The first time you start swirl, you'll be prompted to install a course. You can either install one of the recommended courses or visit the course repository for more options. There are even more courses available from the Swirl Course Network. 

We’re going to install a course which is not part of the repository
To install a course that is not part of our course repository, type ?InstallCourses at the R prompt for a list of functions that will help you do so.

5 Questions:
- Choose an object or phenomena (form list: HYPERLINK) you want to investigate
- Describe  the object formally
- Quantify the object/phenomena into variables
- Form a data-driven research question
- Describe the background for your research question
