# Lecture 1 & Mock-Assessment - The World in Data 

This lecture/workshop/session will focus on how we can see and quantify our world into data. We are going to cover some basic concepts and apply those concepts to a mock-assessment.

## 0) Watch or attend the [opening lecture](https://github.com/BredaUniversity/AAI-DM/blob/881590f3c6c3d682ef56357e4c04e237fa570e27/docs/Year1/BlockA/DataScience/Courses/DS1/Day1/DS1%20-%20Lecture%201;%20The%20world%20in%20data.pptx)

## 1) Mock-Assessment
Every workshop includes a small mock-assessment to prepare you for the actual assessment deliverable you'll create in datalab. In Datalab you and your peers will look at and assess one anothers work so make sure you are prepared.

A) Create a word or excel file with your student number named 'DS_L1_MockAssessment_STUDENTNUMBER' ('STUDENTNUMBER' is the text you replace with your student number in case that wasn't clear) where you answer the following questions:

B) Questions: Defining objects as data

0. Choose an object to define: e.g. in your direct vicinity or something you like or want to understand better.
1. Describe the object formally in at least 100 words.
2. Quantify the object into (at least 10) variables. 
3. Form a data-driven research question based on your variables and the formal description of the object.
4. Describe the background for your research question based on your research question, formal description, variables and other resources found online. References your sources using APA citation.

C) Questions: Defining phenomena as data

0. Choose an phenomena to define: e.g. in your direct vicinity or something you like or want to understand better. 
1. Describe the phenomena formally in at least 100 words.
2. Quantify the phenomena into (at least 10) variables. 
3. Form a data-driven research question based on your variables and the formal description of the phenomena.
4. Describe the background for your research question based on your research question, formal description, variables and other resources found online. References your sources using APA citation.


## 2) Hand-in Documentation
When you are finished with your mock-assignment you can upload your work on team in your respective hand-in slot: Microsoft Teams > Assignments > Data Science 1 > Lecture 1 > Assignemnt

Note: Future R scripts and assignments will be handed in on Github but we'll take it easy for now.

## 3) Next steps: Introduction to R
Now its time for [the workshop part](https://github.com/BredaUniversity/AAI-DM/blob/main/docs/Year1/BlockA/DataScience/Courses/DS1/Day1/DS1_L1_MVP_IntroToR.md) of this class to get acquinted with R.
