# Introduction To Programming

In this introductory module, you will become familiar with foundational concepts in python programming and learn to use Python libraries to read, explore and visualise data. Python is a general purpose programming language that is now widely used for Data Science and AI applications. It is one of the fastest growing programming languages in the AI and Data Science Industry and companies worldwide are using Python to gain insights from their data and add value to their business processes.

Python comes with a set of libraries and you will gain hands on experience with some of the most popular libraries used in AI and Data Science. Further you will use Jupyter notebooks to prototype and share your data science and AI projects, and become familiar with Github for version control. In this module we focus on the following Python libraries (or packages) .

1.  IPython and Jupyter: this library is the most popular development environment for data scientists.
2.  NumPy: this library is the basis for scientific computing in Python.
3.  Pandas: this library allows you to efficiently work with large tabular datasets in Python.
4.  Matplotlib: this library is the standard for data visualization in Python.
5.  Scikit-Learn: this library provides efficient Python implementations of the most popular machine learning algorithms.

## Learning objectives
1. Students develop a basic understanding of Python programming concepts, data types and data structures.
2. Students apply the programming concepts learned and use standard Python data science libraries to solve a project task.
