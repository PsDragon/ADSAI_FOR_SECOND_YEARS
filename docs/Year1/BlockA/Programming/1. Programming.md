# 1. Programming: A Primer

Becoming a data scientist without learning how to program is similar to becoming
an architect without learning how to draw. You will develop a concept design,
but have no means of implementing and sharing it.

While the modules in Data Science and AI will develop your mathematics and statistics knowledge,
this module will focus on developing your **hacking i.e. programming** skills.

### Algorithm
A computer program or algorithm is a setp by step set of instructions which are designed to accomplish a specific outcome. However, the process of writing an optimal computer program involves a lot more than writing code. Designing algorithms and flowcharts to document the process flow, profiling the algorithms' accuracy, documentation and testing are all part of the process of computer programming. Algorithms are typically represented using psuedocodes- an english like syntax that resembles a programming language.

### Flowcharts
One of the key skills you will gain if you succesfully complete this module is computational thinking. The first step towards acquiring this skill is being able to design your algorithm and flow of logic. This is typically done by drawing a flowchart. A flowchart allows you to break down a complex problem into simpler blocks which are then connected to create a computer program. Please watch this video for a brief introduction to a flowchart.

As you may have noticed in the video, a flowchart consists of certain elements.

Process start and end nodes (times when the project starts or ends), project development stages (activities to be carried out), decision nodes (times when a decision needs to be made) and connectors (arrows indicating the project time flow).

## Assignment
**PR1.1** Test your knowledge
<br>
<br>
a) What's an algorithm?
- [ ] A science
- [ ] A step by step set of instruction for solving a specific problem
- [ ] A sequence of steps that repeats indefinitely
- [ ] English like syntax that resembles a programming language

**PR1.2** Develop an algorithm to find the largest of 3 numbers a, b, c. Use PsuedoCode and a flowchart to design your algorithm.
