# 1. Programming: A Primer

Becoming a data scientist without learning how to program is similar to becoming
an architect without learning how to draw. You will develop a concept design,
but have no means of implementing and sharing it.

This module will focus on developing your **hacking i.e. programming** skills.

## What is a program?
A computer program is a setp by step set of instructions which are designed to accomplish a specific outcome. However, the process of writing an optimal computer program involves a lot more than writing code. Designing algorithms and flowcharts to document the process flow, profiling the algorithms' accuracy, documentation and testing are all part of the process of computer programming.

One of the key skills you will gain if you succesfully complete this module is computational thinking. The first step towards acquiring this skill is being able to design your program. This is normally done by drawing a flowchart. A flowchart allows you to break down a complex problem into simpler blocks which are then connected to create a computer program.
