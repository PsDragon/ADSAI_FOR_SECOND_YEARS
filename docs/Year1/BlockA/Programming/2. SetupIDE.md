# Setting up your AI and Data Science environment - Installing Anaconda
Before you start building AI and Data Science applications, you will need to install Python on your computer.
An easy way to install Python on your computer is using **Anaconda** [[2](#2)]. Anaconds is a free python package manager that is geared towards AI and Data Science. In simple terms, installing Anaconda not only installs the latest version of Python, but also installs common python libraries that are used by Data Scientists in the industry. Please watch the below tutorial on how to install Anaconda on your computer. Alternatively, goto <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual> and follow the instructions.

## Jupyter notebooks
The Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that you can use to create and share documents (or notebooks) that can contain  interactive code, documentation, visualizations, and text. By default, when you install Anaconda, jupyter notebook is also installed.

To launch Jupyter Notebook, please open the Anaconda Navigator application. You will observe that Jupyter notebook is indeed installed.
