# Introduction To Programming

Python is a general purpose programming language that is now widely used for Data Science and AI applications. It is one of the fastest growing programming languages in the AI and Data Science Industry. Companies worldwide are using Python to gain insights from their data and add value to their business processes. Unlike Python tutorials from a computer science perspective, this module focuses on Python for AI and Data Science applications. Python comes with a set of libraries and you will gain hands on experience with some of the most popular libraries used in AI and Data Science. A Python library is a collection of saved functions that someone else has designed. In this introductory module, you will learn how to use Python libraries to read, explore and visualise data. Further you will use jupyter notebooks to prototype your applications, and become familiar with Github for version control.

## Learning objectives
1. Students develop a basic understanding of python programming concepts, data types and data structures.
2. Students apply the programming concepts learned and use standard data science libraries to solve a project task.
