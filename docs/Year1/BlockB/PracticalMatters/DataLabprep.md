# DataLab Attendance 

Regular attendance and punctuality in every DataLab is required of each student (by default from 9:00 to 17:00). **A student who has incurred absences of more than two DataLab sessions without a valid reason throughout the block shall not be given credit for the professional ILO(s).** 

A student is considered late when they are not yet present until the fifteenth minute from the start of DataLab (9:15) Two instances of lateness are counted as one absence.

In case of absence, the student needs to fill in the 'DataLab Absence' [form](https://adsai.buas.nl/Contact%20Us/DataLabAttendance.html) in a timely manner (before 9:00), and subsequently proposes and completes activities that are acceptable alternatives to the in-class learning activities. For more details, contact your mentor.
