# Block B - Data Understanding and Preparation

Each of the 8 weeks has a fixed structure : on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday you work individually on the development of basic skills, which are needed to execute the DataLab assignments (Wednesday and Friday). 
Kindly follow the table of contents below, this will guide you through what is expected of you on a daily basis.

## Project Based Learning - Creative Brief
In block A, you explored various themes around digital transformation such as business intelligence using Power BI; and critically examined applications of AI and digital technologies to existing businesses processes. In this block, you will take on a more hands-on approach towards improving a business process using digital transformation. In particular, you will explore one specific role within the theme of digitalisation - **the data analyst** – and help **Banijai** improve their business processes using data, mathematics, and machine learning.


> The client has approached you – the data analyst – with the aim to <add use case here>

At the beginning of the project, you will be introduced to the use-case by a data analyst from one of the municipalities. You can consult the client’s data analyst if you have any questions or wish to deepen your understanding of the use-case.
Please refer to the project brief for more detailed information.
