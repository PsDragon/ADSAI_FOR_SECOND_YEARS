# Block B - Data Understanding and Preparation

Each of the 8 weeks has a fixed structure : on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday you work individually on the development of basic skills, which are needed to execute the DataLab assignments (Wednesday and Friday). 
Kindly follow the table of contents below, this will guide you through what is expected of you on a daily basis.

## Project Based Learning - Creative Brief

In block A, you explored various themes around digital transformation such as business intelligence using Power BI; and critically examined applications of AI and digital technologies to existing businesses processes. In this block, you will take on a more hands-on approach towards improving a business process using digital transformation. In particular, you will explore one specific role within the theme of digitalisation - *the Data Scientist* – and help the client - *Banijay Group* - improve their business processes using data, mathematics, and machine learning.

The [Banijay Group](https://banijaybenelux.com/) is a content creation company for television and multimedia platforms operating within the Media & Entertainment and Telecommunications industries. The group was established in France in 2008, it's present in 21 countries, and it owns 120 production companies that produces 130,000 hours of content such as the world-famous Big Brother, Black Mirror, MasterChef, among many other brands. Banijay's goals are to create, produce and deliver high-quality, multi-genre content and increase its Intellectual Property (IP) through creative entrepreneurship and business acumen.  

> The client has approached you – the Data Scientist – with the aim to analyse their current TV viewership metrics and present a plan to improve their data usage (with multiple sources) and ultimately, increase their TV ratings.

**Specifically, the goal for this block is to develop a model that predicts viewer rating (using Twitter and content data, and any additional data you can collect) using Machine Learning Algorithms and write a report on it. Additionally, the report should contain a section on AI ethics using the knowledge acquired during this block.**

Below you will find the <mark>project requirements</mark>, but there will be an opportunity for you to clarify any questions you may have about the project directly with a stakeholder from Banijay during the **project kick off meeting on Wednesday 23rd November 2022**.

## Project Requirements

With a view to enabling Banijay’s stakeholders to achieve the desired TV ratings, a successful project will meet the following requirements:
