# Block C - Data Modelling

In block A, you explored the foundations of data science and AI and critically examined applications of AI and digital technologies in existing businesses processes. In block B, you went a step further and helped a real-life client get more insight out of their data using data science tools to pre-process, analyse and get insight out of data. In this block, you will take on a more hands-on approach towards data modelling data using tools such as deep learning. In particular, this block will focus on key aspects of **the modelling phase of a data science project lifecycle** such as deep learning, explainable and responsible artificial intelligence (AI), and human-centered design


The research topics include, but are not limited to:
- a topic


## Staff Members


## DataLab Attendance 

Regular attendance and punctuality in every DataLab is required of each student (by default from 9:00 to 17:00). A student who has incurred absences of more than two DataLab sessions without a valid reason throughout the block shall not be given credit for the professional ILO(s). 

A student is considered late when they are not yet present until the fifteenth minute from the start of DataLab (9:15) Two instances of lateness are counted as one absence.

In case of absence, the student needs to fill in the 'DataLab Absence' [form](https://adsai.buas.nl/Contact%20Us/DataLabAttendance.html) in a timely manner (before 9:00), and subsequently proposes and completes activities that are acceptable alternatives to the in-class learning activities. For more details, contact your mentor.

*__Good__* excuses to miss DataLab:

- Personal illness
- Family emergency
- Death of a loved one
- Medical appointment
- Public transportation issue
- Car (or Other) accident
- Etc.

*__Bad__* excuses to miss DataLab:

- Oversleeping
- Being hangover
- Having no babysitter for your rabbit, dog, cat, etc.
- Boyband breakups and/or related drama
- A birthday party for a four-legged pal
- Having no clean underwear to put on
- Going to the beach because a doctor said that you needed more vitamin D
- The universe telling you to take a day off
- Etc.

## Project Based Learning - Creative Brief

 In this project, you will develop responsible and explainable AI algorithms which are human centered.
 This assignment is based on the Kaggle Inclusive Images Challenge (see [here](http://Inclusive%20Images%20Challenge%20|%20Kaggle)) organised jointly by Google and Kaggle.

 Large, publicly available image datasets, such as ImageNet, Open Images and Conceptual Captions are commonly used to develop and rank image classification algorithms. While these datasets are a necessary and critical part of developing useful machine learning (ML) models, some open-source data may be biased. As patterns in such datasets ultimately decide what an AI model learns and predicts, such bias may lead us to develop models that may not necessarily reflect the true reality.

For example, the images below show the predictions of a standard AI image classifier trained to predict if a given image represents a wedding or not. While the AI correctly detects a wedding in the first 3 images, it fails to do so in the last image. This is a consequence of developing an AI algorithm without being sensitive to biases that my exist in the training data.

<br>

Your goal for this block is to fix such broken implementations of AI and ensure that AI remains responsible, transparent and explainable. To this end, you are expected to design, implement and evaluate AI algorithms based on deep neural networks that can accurately classify an image while being sensitive to biases that may be present in the data the network is trained on. Further, keeping the end user in mind, imagine a use-case where such an algorithm would have value and create a protype of an application using the concepts learned in Human centered AI.

At the beginning of the project, you will be introduced to the project by one of the lecturers. Throught out the block, you can consult the lecturers if you have any questions or wish to deepen your understanding of project.
Please refer to the project brief for more detailed information.
