# Block C - Data Modelling

In block A, you explored the foundations of data science and AI and critically examined applications thereof. In block B, you went a step further and helped a real-life client to gain insight into their data by applying various preprocessing and machine learning methods. 

This block will focus on the __*Modeling*__ phase of the __*CRISP-DM*__ lifecycle; you will start incorporating deep learning into your workflow. Therefore, you will learn how to conduct market/consumer research and build transparent, interpretable, and fair AI models. In addition, you will learn how you can embed such an algorithm into an application and how user interaction can help train your model!

## Project Based Learning - Creative Brief

Artificial Intelligence experts are highly sought after, leading many professionals in this field to opt for __*freelance*__ work:

> In 2022, there were 1.2 million people in the Netherlands with self-employment as their primary job, accounting for 12% of the total working population. The sharpest rise in freelancers was seen in the care and welfare domain, followed by the technical, business, and information technology sectors ([Source](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2022/50/aantal-zzp-ers-gegroeid-naar-1-2-miljoen-in-derde-kwartaal-van-2022)). 

One of the main reasons companies hire freelancers is that they are often unsure if they need an in-house professional; if a company has data but is unsure how to use it, it makes more sense to bring in a freelance data professional for a short period to explore and understand the data, business challenges, and opportunities. 

As a freelancer, a balanced combination of both __*soft and hard skills*__ is essential. Your technical proficiency is undoubtedly key, but other aspects, such as business understanding and social skills, are equally important when working on a data science/AI project.

In this block, you will take on the role of freelancing __*- Artificial Intelligence Researcher -*__ to assist a company in digitizing one of their business processes by developing an image classification application prototype using the Imsitu dataset. To this end, you will need to create a __*project proposal*__ that touches upon the following topics:

- Market/consumer research and risk assessment
- The design and implementation of a transparent, interpretable (and fair) deep learning-based image classifier
- The development of a user-centered prototype application for your image classifier 

Below you will find the project requirements, but there will be an opportunity for you to clarify any questions about the project during __*the kick-off meeting on Monday 6th of January 2023*__. 

## Project Requirements

This block has four knowledge modules: Business Understanding, Responsible AI, Deep Learning, and Human-Centered AI. Each module has its own set of deliverables, which are specified below:

- [Business Understanding](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Business%20Understanding/BusinessUnderstandingRequirements.html)
- [Responsible AI](../../Study%20Content/Responsible%20and%20Explainable%20AI/ResponsibleAIRequirements.html)
- [Deep Learning](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/DeepLearning/21.%20Requirements.html)
- [Human-Centered AI](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Human-Centered%20Artificial%20Intelligence/Assignment.html)

Lastly, you are required to create a project proposal presentation as part of the Creative Brief. In this presentation, you will present some of your findings related to the knowledge module requirements to the client: 

- [Project Proposal](MS Teams Assignment Template/Project Proposal Template - Y1C_2022-23_ADSAI.pptx)

For more information, see __*Assessment Rubric*__ in Microsoft Teams. 

## Project Timeline

This project aims to develop an image classification application prototype. Below, you will find the project timeline, which gives you an overview of the tasks related to the knowledge modules:

*Figure 2. Project timeline.*

In __*week 1*__, you will perform an exploratory data analysis to uncover hidden biases in the Imsitu dataset. In addition, you will start with conducting market research to see how you can create an application that generates business value; idea generation (i.e., What are we going to build?). Finally, to further specify your initial idea, you will end the week with a consumer analysis.

:bell: Make sure to update your project proposal presentation regularly!

In __*weeks 2-5*__, you will explore different artificial neural network architectures from which you will gain the skills to create your image classification application prototype. This model does not have to be the final product but will serve as a [proof of concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept) for your application idea. 

In __*week 6*__, after you have built and trained the model, you will learn to balance your model's accuracy and interpretability through the application of various explainable AI methods. 

In __*weeks 7-8*__, you will design an application based on your idea and AI canvas that incorporates your image classifier model. The application design is going to be represented by a wireframe prototype. You will also perform some preliminary user tests, analyze relevant disruptive technology risks and accumulate your findings in a SWOT analysis. 

In __*week 9*__, you will present your project proposal to the client. Here you will be given a chance to showcase, explain and defend your proposed project and its components. 

## Deadlines & Deliverables

The final deliverables need to be handed in on __*Friday, the 7th of April, by 16:59 at the latest*__. The project proposal presentations will take place in week 9 during DataLab days and will be attended by a panel of stakeholders (the lecturers responsible for the ILOs; see the Staff section).

For more information on the deliverables, see the requirements section. 

## Questions?

If you have questions or issues regarding the course material, please post a message on the 'Q&A' channel in Teams. The channel will be monitored by mentors but also please help your peers if you have the answer to their question.

Below you will find the timeline on a day-to-day basis. Further down, there is information on the medals and staff for this block, which includes which staff member to go to for ILO-specific questions.

## Extra Curricular Learning
For proffessional ILO 2 you need to demonstrate self-exploration and personal development, good academic practices in learning how to learn and the acquisition of professional knowledge through research, 
study, analysis, applied practice, discussion and reporting. For each ILO condition, the following should be evidence in your learning log:
- ILO 2.1, Poor: Identify an area of improvement in terms of knowledge and skills, evidence working on this. Confer with your mentor on whether your improvement plan is valid. Tip: Take a look at last blocks self-reflection and work on your identified areas of improvement over there!
- ILO 2.1, Insufficient: You can do this by looking into extracurricular resources (e.g. transformer neural networks) or attending extracurricular activities yourself (e.g. such as attending a guild or [Dealing with stress training](https://hub.buas.nl/read/dealing-with-stress-2/)). 
- ILO 2.1, Sufficient: Your learning and development is clearly evidenced.
- ILO 2.1, Good: Your learning goes beyond the current confines of the project. Something which takes the project to the next level (e.g. fitting a transformer model to do image classification, actually creating your application)
- ILO 2.1, Excellent: you also share your learning/development experience succesfully with your peers and evidence what you learned them. Evidence peer-learning can be done using written
