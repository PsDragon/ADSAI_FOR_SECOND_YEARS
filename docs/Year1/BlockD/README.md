# Block D - Team-based Working

In block D the capstone course of the propaedeutic stage of your bachelor degree. Next to several training elements in planning group projects, keeping track of your individual contribution and cooperation in groups, you are asked to do a full CRISP-DM cycle in a small group. Many of the dynamics will change in this block:

- [ ] Groupwork replaces individual work, but assessment will still be done on your individual contribution;
- [ ] The assessment of your groupwork skills are an explicit element of the assessment in this block;
- [ ] Less emphasis is put on delivery of knowledge and skills. Self-guided learning (under supervision) is the new standard;
- [ ] Skills training mainly consists of project management, communication and working in Teams;

As a result, you will spend much more time on your project. Self-study is limited to one day a week (on Monday), the rest of the week is dedicated to project work.

## Project Based Learning - Creative Brief

In this project, you will work in teams and help the municipality of Breda use
data to improve quality of life for it's citizens. In particular, your team is
expected to use the knowledge and skills gained in blocks A, B & C to **design and develop a data-driven
measure of well-being for Breda?**
