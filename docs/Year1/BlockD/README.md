# Block D - Team-based Working

Block D is the capstone course of the propaedeutic stage of your bachelor degree. Next to several training elements in planning group projects, keeping track of your individual contribution and group collaboration, you are asked to do a full CRISP-DM cycle in a small group. Many of the dynamics will change in this block:

- [ ] Groupwork replaces individual work, but assessment will still be done on your individual contribution;
- [ ] The assessment of your groupwork skills are an explicit element of the assessment in this block;
- [ ] Less emphasis is put on delivery of knowledge and skills. Self-guided learning (under supervision) is the new standard;
- [ ] Skills training mainly consists of project management, communication and working in teams;

As a result, you will spend most of your time on your project.

This block will focus on the __*Deployment*__ phase of the __*CRISP-DM*__ lifecycle; you will learn how to deploy your model or application!

## Creative Brief: Improve Breda
The program "Verbeter Breda" (Improve Breda) works towards equal opportunities, no matter where you grow up in Breda. Within one generation, we want to achieve this. By 2040, everyone should have sufficient opportunities to create a valuable life for themselves, with a focus on housing, education, and income. Residents, schools, businesses, police, housing corporations, healthcare and welfare organizations, the municipality, and the national government work together towards a continuously better Breda.

### Equal opportunities for everyone in Breda
According to the report by the [Audit Office (in Dutch)](https://www.verbeterbreda.nl/uploads/file/104?download=1), there are 16 neighborhoods in Breda: Geeren Noord, Geeren Zuid, Biesdonk, Wisselaar, Doornbos, Linie, Tuinzigt, Schorsmolen/Fellenoord, and the intermediate areas of Haagdijken, Muizenberg, Kesteren, Brabantpark Oost (Epelenberg, Ringenbuurt/Wilderen), Heuvel, and Haagpoort. These neighborhoods bring together people from different backgrounds and cultures, where there is a strong sense of community and entrepreneurial spirit. These are places where people live with ambitions and talents, but apparently, there are also more people with fewer opportunities on average. And it's imperative to do something about that.

In order to make Breda Better, the municipality came up with several cases where more insight using data could be used to create a Better Breda:

| Theme: | Problem Statement: | 
| [Seggregation](../../Year1/BlockD/Themes/Seggration.html) | The municipality of Breda is facing the challenge of social segregation, which refers to the separation of different groups of people based on socioeconomic status, race, or other factors. By addressing social segregation and identifying key influencing factors, the municipality of Breda can promote a more inclusive and cohesive community that benefits all residents. | 
| [Green-index](../../Year1/BlockD/Themes/GreenBreda.html) | Municipality Breda wants to become more sustainable and green; a city within a forest. To achieve this goal, they have developed the green index of Breda. The municipality now requires the green index for the entire city and a better understanding of the factors that contribute to a given green index score. |
| [Public Safety](../../Year1/BlockD/Themes/PublicSafety.html) | Ensuring the safety, both real and perceived, of the citizens is crucial for maintaining a high quality of life in the municipality of Breda. However, the municipality faces challenges in defining and measuring perceived safety, as well as identifying the factors that influence it. Additionally, the municipality needs to determine the appropriate allocation of resources to address upcoming safety concerns. |
| [Public Nuissance](../../Year1/BlockD/Themes/PublicNuissance.html) | To maintain its appeal for a diverse population, Breda must address and minimize public nuisance. However, the municipality faces difficulties in defining public nuisance, understanding its impact on quality of life, and attracting new residents. Furthermore, accurately predicting the necessary number of BOAs (enforcement officers) to prevent public nuisance is a crucial challenge for the municipality. |
| [Pandemic Consequences](../../Year1/BlockD/Themes/Covid19PandemicConsequences.html) | The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and far-reaching impact on the municipality of Breda, both in the short and long term. To fully understand the implications of the pandemic, it is essential to examine the differences in various aspects of life before, during, and after the pandemic. It is essential to understand how these changes have affected the municipality of Breda and to develop strategies to mitigate any negative effects and build a more resilient future. |
| [Quality of Life](../../Year1/BlockD/Themes/QualityofLife.html) | VerbeterBreda aims to improve the quality of lifea nd well-being(QoL)of its inhabitants. Currently QoL places more emphasis on socio-economic indicators. However, climate change affects QoL and its influence is becoming stronger. To this end, it becomes important to understand the effect of weather and environmental variables on QoL in Breda. | 
| [City Bussle and Congestion](../../Year1/BlockD/Themes/CityBustleAndCongestion.html) | The measurement of congestion and city bustle in the municipality of Breda is currently based on the number of people moving in and out of the city center. This city bustle can have a significant impact on the overall liveability and attractiveness of the city center, particularly in regards to parking availability and ease of access for visitors. Reducing congestion and city bustle can improve the liveability and attractiveness of its city center, making it a more desirable destination for visitors and residents alike. |



<!---Therefore, the municipality of Breda examined the state of segregation in Breda and the extent to which Breda's policy is effective in combating segregation in the city. There are several indications that segregation and social inequality between neighbourhoods have increased in the past 10 years. Recent research points to a further increase in social inequality in the Netherlands since the outbreak of the corona crisis. It is therefore imperative that the city of Breda combats such rising inequalities. One of the key driving factors of such segregation is Quality of Life (QoL).

 QoL is traditionally defined by two components:

1. Socio-economic indicators
2. Environmental quality indicators.

Socio-economic indicators include features such as house prices, perception of neighbourhood safety, migration patterns etc. and environmental quality indicators such as noise levels, CO2 levels etc. Traditionally, experts were used to identify key features which could predict QoL accurately and thus help combat neighbourhood segregation – this involved hand-picking features which were hypothesized to be a key determinant of QoL and using those features to help minimize neighbourhood segregation.
-->

**Your creative brief for this block expects you to use the skills and knowledge you have gained over the course of this year to build a tool for the City of Breda to help combat rising segregation in a completely data-driven manner**. This could be for example, a dashboard to provide useful insights, or an AI model that helps predict QoL, or ideally, a combination of both. Once you have developed and deployed the tool, you are expected to provide recommendations to the city of Breda in terms of policy to combat neighbourhood segregation.

In addition, you are expected to ensure that your solution complies to the
latest legal and ethical frameworks. Introductory workshops will be provided on this subject.
Note that the amount of new knowledge and skills to acquire via GitHub classroom is limited: the focus is on participating in a real-life project executed as a group.

### Datasets

### Team-based working - Agile Scrum

For block D, you are expected to follow an agile project management methodology called 'Scrum'. Introductory workshops will introduce you to the scrum way of working.

The Scrum methodology is characterized by short phases called “sprints” wherein
project work: tasks, occurs. During sprint planning, the project team identifies a
small part of the scope; a set of tasks, to be completed during the upcoming sprint,
which is usually a two week period of time.

At the end of the sprint, this work should be ready to be delivered to the
client. Finally, the sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective—or
rather, lessons learned. This cycle is repeated throughout the project
lifecycle until the entirety of the scope has been delivered or block D is at an end.

Please watch the following video to get a brief introduction to scrum as a agile project management methodology.
