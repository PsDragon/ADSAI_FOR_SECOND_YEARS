# Block D - Team-based Working

In block D the capstone course of the propaedeutic stage of your bachelor degree. Next to several training elements in planning group projects, keeping track of your individual contribution and cooperation in groups, you are asked to do a full CRISP-DM cycle in a small group. Many of the dynamics will change in this block:

- [ ] Groupwork replaces individual work, but assessment will still be done on your individual contribution;
- [ ] The assessment of your groupwork skills are an explicit element of the assessment in this block;
- [ ] Less emphasis is put on delivery of knowledge and skills. Self-guided learning (under supervision) is the new standard;
- [ ] Skills training mainly consists of project management, communication and working in Teams;

As a result, you will spend much more time on your project. Self-study is limited to one day a week (on Monday), the rest of the week is dedicated to project work.



## Project Based Learning - Creative Brief

In this project, you will work in teams and help the municipality of Breda use
data to improve quality of life for it's citizens. In particular, your team is
expected to use the knowledge and skills gained in blocks A, B & C to **design and develop a data-driven
measure of well-being for Breda?**

### Team-based working - Agile Scrum

You are expected to follow an agile scrum project management methodology for
this block. Workshops will introduce you to the scrum way of working.

In Scrum project management, the project team, led by the project manager,
consists of a product owner, Scrum master, and other cross-functional team members.
The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product,
while the Scrum master is accountable for ensuring that the project team
follows the Scrum methodology.

The Scrum methodology is characterized by short phases or “sprints” when
project work occurs. During sprint planning, the project team identifies a
small part of the scope to be completed during the upcoming sprint,
which is usually a two week period of time.

At the end of the sprint, this work should be ready to be delivered to the
client. Finally, the sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective—or 
rather, lessons learned. This cycle is repeated throughout the project
lifecycle until the entirety of the scope has been delivered.

In many ways, this mirrors aspects of traditional project management.
One of the key differences, however, is how one creates “shippable” portions of
the project along the way rather than delivering everything at the very end.
Doing so allows the client to realize the value of the project throughout the
process rather than waiting until the project is closed to see results.
