# Block D - Team-based Working (Agile CRISP-DM)

In block D the capstone course of the propaedeutic stage of your bachelor degree. Next to several training elements in planning group projects, keeping track of your individual contribution and cooperation in groups, you are asked to do a full CRISP-DM cycle in a small group. Many of the dynamics will change in this block:

- [ ] Groupwork replaces individual work, but assessment will still be done on your individual contribution;
- [ ] The assessment of your groupwork skills are an explicit element of the assessment in this block;
- [ ] Less emphasis is put on delivery of knowledge and skills. Self-guided learning (under supervision) is the new standard;
- [ ] Skills training mainly consists of project management, communication and working in Teams;

As a result, you will spend much more time on your project. 

## Project Based Learning - Creative Brief

In this project, you will work in teams and help the municipality of Breda use
data to improve quality of life for it's citizens. In particular, your team is
expected to use the knowledge and skills gained in blocks A, B & C to
**design and develop a data-driven
measure of well-being for Breda?**

In addition, you are expected to ensure that you're solution complies to the
latest legal and ethical frameworks. Introductory workshops will be provided on this subject.

Please refer to the project brief for more detailed information.

### Team-based working - Agile Scrum

You are expected to follow an agile scrum project management methodology for
this block. Introductory workshops will introduce you to the scrum way of working.

The Scrum methodology is characterized by short phases or “sprints” when
project work occurs. During sprint planning, the project team identifies a
small part of the scope to be completed during the upcoming sprint,
which is usually a two week period of time.

At the end of the sprint, this work should be ready to be delivered to the
client. Finally, the sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective—or
rather, lessons learned. This cycle is repeated throughout the project
lifecycle until the entirety of the scope has been delivered.

Please watch the following video to get a brief introduction to agile scrum.
