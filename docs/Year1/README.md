# Year 1 - Foundation

In the first year the programme focuses on learning the foundations of Data Science, AI, programming in Python and change management. The knowledge transfer workshops consist of the Mathematics and Statistics modules for big data, Data Science, Neural networks and AI algorithms and basic knowledge of digital transformation, including law and ethics. The skills programme consists of programming with Python and working with libraries. In the DataLab, students work with data from practice on fictional assignments. The aim of the DataLab in this grade is to teach students how to work on solutions in a planned and project-based way. To this end, workshops are held during the DataLab days on topics such as design thinking, project management and oral and written communication (in English). Knowledge and skills from theory modules are explicitly included in the assignments in project education. Communication skills (in the English language) are explicitly included in the assessment. For students who need this, extra (online) supervision takes place in this area.
