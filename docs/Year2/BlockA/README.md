# Block A - Analytics Translator

A creative project brief is like an open invitation. It invites an individual to
propose their own creative vision while still giving a clear direction on the desired outcomes.
It is quite customary in the data science industry for projects to have abstract
requirements. A typical example being “Can we improve our existing business processes using data?”.
Similarly, our creative briefs set out to align with specific learning goals.
The requirements set in the brief below will lead junior data scientists to learn about different topics,
while still allowing for creative freedom in proposing and implementing a solution.
Select an approach that best fits your personal learning goals, investigate the requirements,
and amaze us with your creative problem solving!

In the current block, the creative brief will span the whole block (**7 weeks**) and will focus
on key compentencies of a role unique to the data science and
AI industry- **the analytics translator**.
This role encompasses several skills such as communication, research, analysis,
and to a large extent, decision making.

Here are some articles that describe the role in a bit more detail:

## Creative Brief

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to impact nearly all
domain of the Breda University of Applied Sciences (Buas). While there is no debate
about the positive effects AI may have on these domains,
the technology entails risks and disruptions that warrant attention.
While the management of Buas have begun to discuss AI and it’s applications
more frequently, the general attitudes and sentiment of the various domains
are yet to be taken into account.  It is vital to understand how these domains
think about AI and understand factors that influence the acceptance of AI in
these domains. Such understanding is essential to crafting informed policy
and identifying opportunities to include AI in the curriculum of these domains.


**Your goal for this block is to use quantitative and qualitative methods to
explore and understand (staff and student)
attitudes, knowledge, acceptance, and perceived impact of AI across
Buas domains and guide stakeholders towards the best course of action.**

<br>

<mark>Please note that during weeks 1 to 4, you will work in a group. Weeks 4 to 7
is individual work. This ensure that you can pool in resources for study design,
data collection, and data management; while allowing for individual preferences in
data analyses and project dissemination.</mark>

The project timeline is aligned with the knowledge modules you will find on
the ADSAI digital learning environment.

### Week 1
The block begins with a block kickoff
followed by a mini-conference in AI. This conference will provide you with insights
into how the different domains in Buas tend to think about AI (general attitudes,
 acceptance, percepetion, knowledge etc.). Use this week
to perform a literature review and design hypotheses which you will then put
to the test in the upcoming weeks.

The knowledge modules linked to this phase are:<br>
- [ ] [Foundations of Quantitative Research Design](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/academic-research-foundations-quantitative/welcome?autoplay=true&u=36359204) <br>
- [ ] [Foundations of Qualitative Research Design](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/market-research-qualitative/the-power-of-qualitative-research?autoplay=true&u=36359204)


### Week 2-4
Use these weeks to design your study, gather your data, and ensure that you
have a strategy for data management.

The knowledge modules linked to this phase are:

### Week 5-6
Use these weeks to explore and analyse your data using statistical methods.

The knowledge modules linked to this phase are:

- [ ] [Quantitative Data Analysis: A Primer](../../Study%20Content/Statistical%20Inference/)
- [ ] [Intermediate Statistics](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/statistics-foundations-2/welcome?autoplay=true&u=36359204)
- [ ] [Advanced Statistics](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/statistics-foundations-3/welcome?autoplay=true&u=36359204)

### Week 7
In this week, you are expected to report and present your project findings.

The knowledge modules linked to this phase are:


## Project Requirements

Your project should:
- [ ] use a validated scale to measure how staff and students
think about AI.
- [ ] consist of quantitative as well as qualitative data.
- [ ] adhere to the [Buas Data Management Protocol](https://edubuas.sharepoint.com/sites/researchdevelopment/SitePages/Datamanagement.aspx), in particular ensuring that your data is F.A.I.R.

## Project Deliverables

Your final (**group**) deliverable is a Data Management documentation which contains:
- [ ] description of the data collection process (which tools/instruments are used).
- [ ] description of the data: what is the format (file-type) of the data.
- [ ] a codebook describing variables.
- [ ] description of data storage protocol: file structure and filenames.



Your final (**individual**) deliverables are:
- [ ] technical report documenting your findings (APA style, Latex formatted).
- [ ] conference poster
- [ ] conference presentation
