# Block A - Analytics Translator

A creative project brief is like an open invitation. It invites an individual to
propose their own creative vision while still giving a clear direction on the desired outcomes.
It is quite customary in the data science industry for projects to have abstract
requirements. A typical example being “Can we improve our existing business processes using data?”.
Similarly, our creative briefs set out to align with specific learning goals.
The requirements set in the brief below will lead junior data scientists to learn about different topics,
while still allowing for creative freedom in proposing and implementing a solution.
Select an approach that best fits your personal learning goals, investigate the requirements,
and amaze us with your creative problem solving!

In the current block, the creative brief will span the whole block (**7 weeks**) and will focus
on key compentencies of a role unique to the data science and
AI industry- **the analytics translator**.
This role encompasses several skills such as communication, research, analysis,
and to a large extent, decision making.

Here are some articles that describe the role in a bit more detail:

## Creative Brief: AI at BUAS

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are predicted to impact nearly all
domains of the Breda University of Applied Sciences (Buas). While there is no debate
about the positive effects AI may have on these domains,
the technology entails risks and disruptions that warrant attention.
While the management of Buas have begun to discuss AI and it’s applications
more frequently, the general attitudes and sentiment of the various domains
are yet to be taken into account.  It is vital to understand how these domains
think about AI and understand factors that influence the acceptance of AI in
these domains. Such understanding is essential to crafting informed policy
and identifying opportunities to include AI in the curriculum of these domains. For an example of how this understanding is gained, and why research skills are essential, click [here](https://governanceai.github.io/US-Public-Opinion-Report-Jan-2019/executive-summary.html).


**Your goal for this block is to use quantitative and qualitative methods to
explore and understand (staff and student)
attitudes, knowledge, acceptance, and perceived impact of AI across
Buas domains and guide stakeholders towards the best course of action regarding AI at Buas.**

<br>

> <mark>Please note that during weeks 1 to 4, you will work in a group. Weeks 4 to 7
is individual work.</mark> <br> This ensures that you can pool in resources for study design,
data collection, and data management; while allowing for individual preferences in
data analyses and project dissemination.

The project timeline is aligned with the knowledge modules you will find on
the ADSAI digital learning environment. A proposed [day-by-day timeline can be found here](https://edubuas.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/2022-23AFGA2.P1ADSAI/Class%20Materials/Y2blockA_PlanningProposal.xlsx?d=wdec80798c0834878afba8fdb85d7c82d&csf=1&web=1&e=LP7dmD) if you find that helpful.


### Week 1
The block begins with a block kickoff
followed by a mini-conference in AI. This conference will provide you with insights
into how the different domains in Buas tend to think about AI (general attitudes,
 acceptance, percepetion, knowledge etc.). 

> 8 September, Chapel, Buas <br>
Student conference: AI Applied to Buas Domains. <br>

You are expected to start drafting a research proposal individually by the end of Week 1.

### Week 2-4
Use week 2 to design your study and submit your research proposal. Once your proposal is approved, as a team, gather your quantitative and qualitative data in week 3 and 4, ensuring that you have a strategy for data management.

The knowledge modules linked to this phase are:

- [ ] [Research Methods:](https://www.coursera.org/learn/research-methods){:target="_blank"} <br> Complete the first 3 week modules and take a screenshot of each completed quiz; your score does not count towards your final grade, and attach it to your learning log. Do the week 4 module on Thursday the 15th of September, reflect on your research design in your learning log in separate slide and iterate on it accordingly.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- [ ] [Qualitative Methods:](https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantitative-methods){:target="_blank"} Complete the first 6 week modules and take a screenshot of each completed quiz; your score does not count towards your final grade, and attach it to your learning log.
