## DataLab Attendance 

Regular attendance and punctuality in every DataLab is required of each student (by default from 9:00 to 17:00). A student who has incurred absences of more than two DataLab sessions without a valid reason throughout the block shall not be given credit for the professional ILO(s). 

A student is considered late when they are not yet present until the fifteenth minute from the start of DataLab (9:15) Two instances of lateness are counted as one absence.

In case of absence, the student needs to fill in the 'DataLab Absence' [form](https://adsai.buas.nl/Contact%20Us/DataLabAttendance.html) in a timely manner (before 9:00), and subsequently proposes and completes activities that are acceptable alternatives to the in-class learning activities. For more details, contact your mentor.

# Creative Brief

In the past five years, leading companies like Philips and Nokia have started integrating artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, into their manufacturing processes. Recently, small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs), seeking a competitive edge, also started to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. However, digitalizing a business comes with several challenges, especially for SMEs, which do not have the same resources as more prominent manufacturing companies. To answer questions like 'Where should you focus, and how should you start?' requires expert knowledge from professionals such as an Artificial Intelligence Researcher, and Analytics Translator.

*Figure 1. WWA employers working on robot arm.*

[WWA](https://www.wwa.nl/), a regional SME in manufacturing-process automation,  hereafter the client, has approached you as an – Artificial Intelligence Researcher – to digitilize its business processes by designing and developing a practical, Industry 4.0, robotics application that can perform bin picking by applying cognitive models, (advanced) reinforcement learning and computer vision algorithms. 

Good luck!

## Project Requirements
Consider each of these task as mandatory to complete your project:

### Computer Vision

In the first three weeks of Block B, you will acquire foundational knowledge and understanding of the theories, principles, methods, and techniques related to the field of computer vision. For example, you will be made familiar with various object detection algorithms, which deploy a traditional or deep learning-based approach to localizing and classifying objects in visual media. In addition, we will teach you to apply these algorithms to annotated image datasets comprised of either real-life or synthetic data. 

To solve the project's computer vision task, you need to:

- Demonstrate foundational knowledge and understanding of the theories, principles, methods, and techniques related to the (sub)fields of computer vision by interpreting, and subsequently disseminating the project findings via a written report (ILO 2.1). For example, you will have to provide a written technical analysis of the implemented object detection algorithm (Sufficient). 
- Acquire, store and process raw image data in a way that allows for data exploration and analysis (ILO 3.1). For example, as a team, you will need to create two (2) annotated image datasets for object detection (Poor).
-  Implement a traditional and DL object detection algorithm, making appropriate use of current tools and libraries, and cognitive models (ILO 3.2). For example, you will need to build, (train), and evaluate a traditional and deep learning-based object detection algorithm (Sufficient).

### Robotics and Reinforcement Learning

### _Implement a baseline controller_ (ILO 4.1)

Use traditional control methods combined with computer vision to create a controller for a simulated robotic arm to enable it to perform a pick and place task. 
The arm needs to: 
- Locate objects in its workspace 
- Classify the objects 
- Pick up the object
- Place the objects in a specific area based on the classification 
    
### _Investigate the feasibility of the application of reinforcement learning to the pick and place task_ (ILO 4.2)
Use reinforment learning to develop a controller for a simulated robotic arm to enable it to perform a pick and place task. Create and compare different reinforcement learning controllers using different: 
- Models (e.g. DQN, A2C, PPO, etc.) 
- Action spaces (e.g. discrete, continuous, etc.)
- Observation spaces (e.g. image, vector, etc.)
- Hyperpameters 
- Reward fucntions 

You will also need to compare these controllers to the baseline controller, and determine which controller is the most suitable for the pick and place task.

### Cognition
Complete the cognition task by using cognitive theory and cognitive models to **conceptualize**, build (implemented in the 'Computer Vision' task & 'Robotics and Reinforcement Learning' task) and **improve on** the application.

Evidence in technical report, and integrate in object detection algorithm:
- Identifies appropriate perceptual features for object detection. (ILO 3.2 - Sufficient)
- Identifies required prior-knowledge for contextualizing object detection. (ILO 3.2 - Good)
- Uses cognitive models of pattern recognition to improve feature and/or object detection. (ILO 3.2 - Excellent)

Evidence in technical report, and integrate in robotic controller & reinforcement learning algorithm:
- Identifies relevant environmental input required for situational awareness & setup for processing said input. (ILO 4.1 - Poor & Insufficient)
- The robot controller can respond to different situational conditions using formal logic. (ILO 4.1 - Excellent)
- Identifies relevant environmental input required for RL & setup for processing said input. (ILO 4.2 - Poor & Insufficient)
- Suggestions for model improvement, real-world implementation, knowledge acquisition and decision-making are made. (ILO 4.2 - Excellent)

### Technical Report
- Describes the data aquisition, and pre-processing steps (e.g., annotation, quality assessment, etc.) (ILO 2.1 - Insufficient)
- Provides a written technical analysis of the implemented object detection, and robot control algorithm (ILO 2.1 - Sufficient). For more information, see 'Technical analysis' section of [DL computer vision I: Theory](../../Study%20Content/ComputerVision/DLComputerVision1a.html).
- Provides written recommendations for further research, taking into account the client's  business strategy (ILO 2.1 - Good)
