# Block B - Artificial Intelligence Scientist - Vision & Robotics

In Block B, which spans eight weeks, you will explore one specific role within a professional data team - The Artificial Intelligence Researcher. During the block, you will work on a Computer vision and Robotics themed real-use case. The research topics include, but are not limited to:

- Computer vision; Object detection (e.g., YOLO, Faster-RCNN, etc.)
- Reinforcement learning (e.g., )
- MLOps (e.g., bash scripting, model registry, etc.)

# Creative Brief

In the past five years, leading companies like Philips and Nokia have started integrating artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, into their manufacturing processes. Recently, small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs), seeking a competitive edge, also started to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. However, digitalizing a business comes with several challenges, especially for SMEs, which do not have the same resources as more prominent manufacturing companies. To answer questions like 'Where should you focus, and how should you start?' requires expert knowledge from professionals such as an Artificial Intelligence Researcher, and Analytics Translator.

WWA, a regional SME in manufacturing-process automation,  hereafter the client, has approached you as an – Artificial Intelligence Researcher – to digitilize its business processes by designing and developing a practical, Industry 4.0, robotics application that can perform bin picking by applying (advanced) reinforcement and computer vision algorithms. 

Good luck!

## Project Timeline

The project timeline is aligned with the knowledge modules you will find in the ADS&AI digital learning environment.
