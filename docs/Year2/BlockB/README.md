# Block B - Artificial Intelligence Scientist - Vision & Robotics

In Block B, which spans eight weeks, you will explore one specific role within a professional data team - The Artificial Intelligence Researcher. During the block, you will work on a Computer vision and Robotics themed real-use case. The research topics include, but are not limited to:

- Computer vision; Object detection (e.g., YOLO, Faster-RCNN, edge detection, etc.)
- Reinforcement learning (e.g., )
- Cognition: models of perception, decision-making and action within situational context
- MLOps (e.g., bash scripting, virtual environments, etc.)

# Creative Brief

In the past five years, leading companies like Philips and Nokia have started integrating artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, into their manufacturing processes. Recently, small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs), seeking a competitive edge, also started to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. However, digitalizing a business comes with several challenges, especially for SMEs, which do not have the same resources as more prominent manufacturing companies. To answer questions like 'Where should you focus, and how should you start?' requires expert knowledge from professionals such as an Artificial Intelligence Researcher, and Analytics Translator.

*Figure 1. WWA employers working on robot arm.*

WWA, a regional SME in manufacturing-process automation,  hereafter the client, has approached you as an – Artificial Intelligence Researcher – to digitilize its business processes by designing and developing a practical, Industry 4.0, robotics application that can perform bin picking by applying (advanced) reinforcement, cognitive models and computer vision algorithms. 

Good luck!

## Project Timeline

The project timeline is aligned with the knowledge modules you will find in the ADS&AI digital learning environment.

Note: During Weeks 1-2, you will work in a project group, Weeks 3-8 are devoted to individual work. This ensures that you can pool resources for data collection, and data management; while allowing for individual preferences in data analyses and project dissemination.

### Week 1

The block starts with a kick-off lecture. 

- [Field trip: WWA]()
- [WSL2 Setup](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Robotics%20and%20Reinforcement%20Learning/WSL2.html)
- [Robotic Simulation Primer](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Robotics%20and%20Reinforcement%20Learning/Robotic%20Simulation%20Primer.html)
- [Data collection]()
- [Data management](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Research%20Methodology/Overview.html)

In this block we don't work with humans or animals but with robots which makes our lives much easier! Therefore, we don't need to bother ourselves with a letter of informed consent or a research information letter. For this block we need to use and fill in the following templates: [ ] BUas Ethics Review; [ ] Research Data Management Guide; [ ] Codebook. *This is a group deliverable*, so you can all hand-in the same files; and evidence that you did follow through with you Research Data Management Plan & Procedures described in there. Make sure that you contribute to each of these deliverables and are able to evidence this!

## Project Requirements

### Computer Vision Task

In the first three weeks of Block B, you will acquire foundational knowledge and understanding of the theories, principles, methods, and techniques related to the field of computer vision. For example, you will be made familiar with various object detection algorithms, which deploy a traditional or deep learning-based approach to localizing and classifying objects in visual media. In addition, we will teach you to apply these algorithms to annotated image datasets comprised of either real-life or synthetic data. 

To solve the project's computer vision task, you need to:

- Create three (3) annotated image datasets for object detection;
- Explore the (meta)data, and subsequently assess its quality;
- Identify, and select appropriate object detection algorithms to solve the computer vision task;
- Build, (train), and evaluate a traditional and deep learning-based object detection algorithm
- Incorporate your research findings in a technical report

### Robotics and Reinforcement Learning Task

### _Implement baseline controller_

Use traditional control methods combined with computer vision to create a controller for a simulated robotic arm to enable it to perform a pick and place task.
The arm needs to: 
- Locate objects in its workspace 
- Classify the objects 
- Place the objects in a specific area based on the classification 
    
### _Investigate the feasibility of the application of reinforcement learning to the pick and place task_

Create and compare different reinforcement learning controllers using different: 
- models 
- action spaces
- observation spaces
- hyperpameters 
- reward fucntions
