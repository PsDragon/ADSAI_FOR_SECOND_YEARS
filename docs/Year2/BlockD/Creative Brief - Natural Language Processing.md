# Disaster Response Assistance through Tweet Classification and Analysis using Natural Language Processing

## Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a Python package for a disaster response assistance system that classifies and analyzes tweets during natural disasters or emergencies. The package should be built based on the proof-of-concept (PoC) notebooks and scripts created in block C. The application should be accessible through a command-line interface (CLI) and should also be deployable as an API using cloud services.

## Goals

Create a system that can process, classify, and analyze tweets related to natural disasters or emergencies:

- The system should be modular and adaptable to various disaster scenarios.
- The system should accept a stream of tweets as input and should output the classified tweets and their relevant information.
- Information about the certainty of the predictions should also be provided.
- It should be possible to train the system on a local machine or on a cloud service.
- Analysis should be performed on a continuous stream of tweets, and the results should be displayed on a web interface and be accessible through an API. This allows the system to be deployed on any platform regardless of the hardware specifications.
- Incorporate MLOps best practices for managing data environments, training, and deployment on Azure Machine Learning in order to ensure the system is scalable and maintainable.


## Technical Requirements

__Python Package__
- Combine the PoC notebooks and scripts into a single, cohesive Python package.
- Organize the package into modular components for easy maintenance and extensibility.
- Ensure the package adheres to Python best practices and follows PEP8 guidelines.
- Use logging to record the application's progress and output, and to provide useful information for debugging.
- Implement a user-friendly CLI for interacting with the application.
- Support basic functionality such as training, evaluation, and analysis.
- Provide options for customization of input/output file paths, model parameters, and other relevant settings.
- Unit test the package to ensure its functionality and reliability.

__Documentation__
- Use docstrings and type hints to document the Python package.
- Create comprehensive documentation for the Python package, CLI, API, and MLOps processes.
- Include detailed instructions for installation, usage, and troubleshooting.
- Provide examples and sample code to demonstrate the application's functionality and MLOps best practices.
- Ideally, the documentation should be hosted on a website using GitHub Pages.

__MLOps Best Practices__
- Set up data environments on Azure, ensuring proper data storage, versioning, and access control.
- Implement automated training pipelines with Azure Machine Learning, incorporating hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.
- Integrate CI/CD practices for seamless deployment and updates of the application.
- Monitor the performance of the deployed models, implementing automated alerts and retraining when necessary.
- Maintain detailed logs of model experiments, training runs, and deployments.
- Implement a rollback strategy in case of unexpected errors or performance degradation.
- Allow for continuous model training and deployment using the latest data with minimal human intervention and sound deployment practices and strategies.

__API Deployment__
- Develop an API for deploying the application on Azure services.
- Ensure proper authentication and security measures are in place.
- Ideally, methods for training, evaluation, and analysis should be implemented within the API.
- Ideally, the API should be accessible through a web interface and should also be callable from other applications.

__Testing and Validation__
- Test the application on a range of scenarios to ensure its accuracy, reliability, and scalability.
- Validate the application's performance using relevant evaluation metrics.
- Ensure the application is robust to common errors and exceptions.

## Deliverables
- A modular Python package that can be installed using pip or whl file.
- A fully-functional CLI for interacting with the application.
- A web interface/API for interacting with the application.
- Comprehensive documentation, including installation and usage instructions, troubleshooting tips, and example code.

## Timeline

This project is expected to be completed within a 8-week period. Regular progress updates and milestone check-ins will be scheduled with the product owner.
