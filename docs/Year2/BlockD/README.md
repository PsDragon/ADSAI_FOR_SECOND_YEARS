# Block D - Engineer - MLOps

In Blocks B and C you built machine learning models for computer vision and natural language processing. The focus was on the modelling component of the CRISP-DM cycle. You produced proof of concept models that were able to solve a given problem. However, these models were not production ready. In this block you will learn how to productionise and deploy your model/s to a cloud platform. You will also learn how to monitor your model/s and ensure that they are continuously retrained on new data. You will create a robust codebase and establish data ingestion and model training pipelines. Additionally, you will learn how to devise a model deployment approach and implement a monitoring strategy. Finally, you will learn how to demonstrate your deployed model/s in action.


# Project Based Learning - Creative Brief

| Option 1: Computer Vision and Robotics | Option 2: Natural Language Processing |
|---|---|
| In block C, you built computer vision models for object detection, localisation and pose prediction. This block your task is to productionise and deploy your model/s to a cloud platform. | During emergencies, individuals, news agencies, disaster relief organizations, and emergency management agencies use social media for communication, information diffusion, making sense of the event, and managing risks. As a result, Twitter has become an essential communication channel during natural disasters and terror attacks. On the other hand, Twitter contains vast amounts of misinformation, making accurate identification of emergency tweets indispensable. In block C, you built NLP models for identifying emergency tweets. This block your task is to productionise and deploy your model/s to a cloud platform.  |

## Project Requirements

Select one of the given options and develop a production-grade model that can be deployed on a cloud platform. Your tasks include creating a robust codebase, establishing data ingestion and model training pipelines, devising a model deployment approach, and implementing a monitoring strategy. Additionally, you must demonstrate your deployed model(s) in action.

Requirements:

- Develop a scalable API that accepts input data and returns predictions along with - confidence scores
- Ensure that the model supports automatic retraining on a weekly basis
- Continuously monitor prediction accuracy to prevent model drift
- Maintain clear records of the deployed model and its training process for auditing purposes
- Minimize manual intervention in deployment, with manual approval required for production
- Store and manage code in a code repository, such as Azure DevOps or GitHub


## Project Deliverables - Due Friday 23rd June 2023

- [ ] A GitHub repository containing all the code and documentation for your project.
- [ ] A README.md file containing a description of your project, how to install your package and how to use it.
- [ ] Installable Python package(s) containing your code. (Include a wheel file and a source distribution)
- [ ] Microsoft Azure ML workspace containing your model/s.
- [ ] A demo of the deployed model/s.
- [ ] Project planning and scoping document, including tasks, timelines and sprint planning.
